### Who is Richard Feynman?

**Richard Feynman** (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical [[physicist\|physicist]] renowned for his groundbreaking contributions to quantum [[electrodynamics (QED)\|electrodynamics (QED)]], [[particle physics\|particle physics]], and the development of scientific visualization tools like **[[Feynman diagrams\|Feynman diagrams]]**. He was widely regarded as one of the most brilliant and influential physicists of the 20th century, known for his innovative thinking, engaging teaching style, and eccentric personality. Feynman shared the **1965 [[Nobel Prize\|Nobel Prize]] in Physics** with [[& Julian Schwinger\|& Julian Schwinger]] and [[& Shin’ichirō Tomonaga\|& Shin’ichirō Tomonaga]] for their work on QED, which describes how light interacts with matter and charged particles[1][2][3].

### Brief History

1. **Early Life and Education**:
   - Born in Queens, New York, Feynman showed early aptitude for mathematics and science. He earned a bachelor's degree from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT\|Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT]] in 1939 and a Ph.D. from [[Princeton University\|Princeton University]] in 1942, where he developed the [[principle of least action\|principle of least action]] in [[quantum mechanics\|quantum mechanics]][1][5].

2. **Manhattan Project**:
   - At age 24, Feynman joined the top-secret [[Manhattan Project\|Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II\|World War II]] to help develop the atomic bomb. He worked at [[Los Alamos\|Los Alamos]] as part of Hans Bethe's theoretical division, contributing to calculations on nuclear reactions and safety protocols[5][6].

3. **Academic Career**:
   - After the war, Feynman taught at [[Cornell University\|Cornell University]] before joining [[Caltech\|Caltech]] in 1950, where he conducted much of his groundbreaking research in QED, superfluidity, and particle physics[6].

4. **Later Years**:
   - In the 1980s, Feynman served on the [[Rogers Commission\|Rogers Commission]] investigating the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster, famously demonstrating that cold temperatures caused the O-ring failure[3][6].

### Key Contributions

1. **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**:
   - Feynman revolutionized QED by resolving inconsistencies in earlier theories and introducing **Feynman diagrams**, which graphically represent particle interactions to simplify complex calculations[1][2].

2. **Superfluidity**:
   - He provided a quantum explanation for the frictionless behavior of liquid helium near absolute zero[1].

3. **Weak Force Theory**:
   - Collaborated with [[Murray Gell-Mann\|Murray Gell-Mann]] to describe particle decay processes governed by the weak nuclear force[1].

4. **Parton Model**:
   - Proposed "[[partons\|partons]]," hypothetical particles inside protons that paved the way for understanding [[quarks\|quarks]][1].

5. **Nanotechnology and Quantum Computing**:
   - Pioneered ideas in nanotechnology with his famous lecture *"[[{ There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\|{ There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]"* and explored early concepts of [[quantum computing\|quantum computing]][3][4].

### Legacy

Feynman was not only a brilliant scientist but also a gifted communicator who popularized physics through books like *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*, *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!*, and *What Do You Care What Other People Think?*. His unique approach to teaching inspired generations of scientists and laypeople alike[4]. He remains an icon of intellectual curiosity, blending rigorous science with playful creativity to explore the mysteries of nature.
