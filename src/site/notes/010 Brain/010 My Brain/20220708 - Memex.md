- "(The publication of new material) has been extended far beyond or present ability to make use of the record. The summation of human expreience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square rigged boats"
- In response to [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202205022046 - Information Exhaustion\|202205022046 - Information Exhaustion]] or "Overload:"
	- "The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it."
	- He Proposed of a new kind of personal cataloguing machine, called a memex, that would be useful not only to scientists but to anyone employing 'logical processes of thought.'
	- Incorporated into a desk, the memex is a device  in which an individual stores (in compressed form)  all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility." On top of the desk are "translucent screens" onto which are projected images of the stored materials as well as "a keyboard" and "set of buttons and levers" to navigate the database.
	- The essential feature of the machine is its use of associative indexing to link different pieces of information: "Any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another."
		- *This process of "tying two things together is the important thing"*
