1st law of [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202108012051 - Laws of Combat\|202108012051 - Laws of Combat]] - [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/{ Leadership, Strategies, and Tactics\|{ Leadership, Strategies, and Tactics]]

A unit in. the field by itself is a fraction of what it is when it has another unit supporting it. **Two teams working together, covering and moving for each other, don't just double their effectiveness; they multiply their impact and capability exponentially.** Without coordination and cooperation between individuals, between elements within a team, and between teams, all is lost.

**Supporting Distance:** Maintain a supporting distance between elements-a doctrinal term that for small units means the distance between two units that can be covered effectively by their fires. I would add to this that the distance must be able to be covered by primary or at least secondary communications. That way, each element can get help if they need it. As soon as an element is out of supporting distance, they are all but doomed.
