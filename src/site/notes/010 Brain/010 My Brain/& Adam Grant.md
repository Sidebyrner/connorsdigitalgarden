## ## **I. Thinking & Rethinking**
-   **Progress** isn’t always about getting better. Sometimes it’s about bouncing back. 
-   **Success** is not only the peaks you reach — it’s the valleys you conquer. 
-   **Every experience** of enduring adversity and overcoming obstacles is a meaningful accomplishment. 
-   **Resilience** is a form of growth.
