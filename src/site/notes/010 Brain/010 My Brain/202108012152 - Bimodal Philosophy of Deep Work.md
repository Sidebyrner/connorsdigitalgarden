# Definition
Divide your time, dedicating some clearly defines stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else

The minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least **one full day**

# Notes

-   Those who deploy the bimodal philosophy of deep work admire the productivity of the monastics but also respect the value they receive from the shallow behaviors in their working lives
-   People will usually respect your right to become inaccessible if these periods are well defines and well advertised, and outside these stretches, you're once again easy to find.

## Examples

-   On a **week's scale,** dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time
-   **Yearly scale,** dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches
