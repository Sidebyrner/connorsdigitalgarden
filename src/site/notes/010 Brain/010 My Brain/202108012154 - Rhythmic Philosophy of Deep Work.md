# Definition
> Transform deep work sessions into a simple regular habit

Generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need to you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep

# Notes

-   Works well with the reality of human nature making sure that a little gets done every day
-   Some jobs don't let you disappear for days at a time - **making strong case for office jobs**

## Example

-   **Chain Method:** Have a calendar on your wall and mark and "X" on each day that you execute on a habit or activity. You will soon have a chain of "X's" that you won't want to break
-   Set a time each day to work (i.e Start work by 5 a.m., finish by 7). By having a set time frame and obligation each day, as soon as that requirement is fulfilled for the day, it is out of sight, out of mind.
