- To put your ego in check you much have incredible confidence. If you find you cannot put your ego in check because you are afraid it might make you look weak, then guess what? You _are_ weak. Don't be weak.
- By subordinating your ego, you have the strength and confidence to give the other person credit, and they will recognize and respect that confidence.
