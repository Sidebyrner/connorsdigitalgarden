# Definition
You have to play the long game. Try to support the boss and perform your duties to the best of your ability.

-   In playing the game, You are building up trust with your boss, you are building a relationship.
-   You are not trying to build a relationship for personal gain; You are trying to build a relationship with your boss so we can better accomplish the missions.
-   My goal was always the same: to build a relationships with them so they trusted me, gave me what I needed to get the job done, got of my way, and let me accomplish the mission

> Hey boss, I just wanted to make sure I completely understand why you want it done this way so I can fully support your plan."
