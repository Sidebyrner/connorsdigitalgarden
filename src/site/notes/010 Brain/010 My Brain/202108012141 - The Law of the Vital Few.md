        1.  The key is to keep the list limited to **what is most important**
        2.  keep the descriptions suitable high-level
    2.  List for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal
    3.  Consider the network tools you currently use.
        1.  For each tool, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of the tool has a _substantially positive impact_ or a _substantially negative impact,_ or _little impact_ on your regular and successful participation in the activity.
        2.  Keep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive impacts that outweigh the negatives
