# Quote

> **Extreme Ownership** is a mind-set of not making excuses and not blaming anyone or anything else when problems occur. Instead of casting blame or making excuses, good leaders and good teams take **Extreme Ownership** of the problems, find solutions, and implement those solutions. Failure to take ownership results in problems never being solved and teams never improving.
