Historian and former director of the Harvard University Library

> Unlike. modern readers, who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern Englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book to book...Reading and writing (are) inseparable activities. *The world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of you own, one stamped with your personality.*

"Time was when readers kept commonplace books. Whenever they came across a pithy passage, they copied it into a notebook under an appropriate heading, adding observations made in the course of daily life[5](https://indextrious.blogspot.com/2012/05/joys-of-commonplace-book.html)."
