# Quote

> Everyone on the team must understand that goal. It must be clear. In addition to the goal being simple and clear, plans and directives must be communicated up and down the chain of command in a simple, clear, concise manner that can be comprehended by everyone. ~implicity is key, because **if the team members cannot understand the goal or the plan to accomplish that goal, there is no possible way they can execute.**
