> Everyone on the team must step up and lead.

# Quote

"What if each of those fire team leaders clearly knew what your intent was and what you wanted the task unit to accomplish, and they took initiative to make that intent come to fruition?" It was a rhetorical question, because they knew the answer. If the fire team leaders were moving their teams toward the commander's broad goal on their own initiative, things would be fairly easy for the task unit commander. But that all hinged on the task unit commander simply and clearly conveying his intent. Only if the fire team leaders understood that intent could they execute anything. And their execution also depended on their confidence to make decisions and the level of empowerment they felt. Only if the fire team leaders felt they were empowered to make things happen would they step up and lead. That empowerment had to be ingrained in the minds of the subordinate leaders; it had to be embedded in the culture of the team.
