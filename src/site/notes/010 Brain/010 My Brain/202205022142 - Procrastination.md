## From [[Ali Abdaal\|Ali Abdaal]]
### 1 - Procrastination as Resistance
- Procrastination is the soul rebelling against entrapment.
- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, [_The Bed of Procrustes_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75uxg65d5kh8hkv69ektz/dpheh0hqvvpddnul/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL2JhQ0N0VQ==)​

### 2 - Procrastination as Revenge
- [_Revenge Bedtime Procrastination is..._] a psychological phenomenon, where people stay up later than they desire in an attempt to have control over the night, because they perceive themselves (perhaps subconsciously) to lack influence over events during the day.
	- - Daphne K. Lee, [_How “Revenge Bedtime Procrastination” Explains Modern Life_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75uxg65d5kh8hkv69ektz/e0hph7hk66rmmgh7/aHR0cHM6Ly9ncmVhdGlzdC5jb20vZGlzY292ZXIvcmV2ZW5nZS1iZWR0aW1lLXByb2NyYXN0aW5hdGlvbg==) [originally from a now-deleted tweet]

### 3 - Procrastination as Naivety
- It’s not that procrastinators don’t like the _concept_ of doing. They look at the bricks on their calendar and they think, “Great, this will be fun.” And that’s because when they _picture_ the moment in the future when they sit down and knock out a work session, they picture things without the presence of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
- Procrastinators’ visions of future scenarios never seem to include the monkey. But when the actual moment arrives to begin that scheduled brick-laying, the procrastinator does what the procrastinator does best—he lets the monkey take over and ruin everything.
	- Tim Urban, [_Why Procrastinators Procrastinate_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75uxg65d5kh8hkv69ektz/7qh7h8h0qqndd2s9/aHR0cHM6Ly93YWl0YnV0d2h5LmNvbS8yMDEzLzEwL3doeS1wcm9jcmFzdGluYXRvcnMtcHJvY3Jhc3RpbmF0ZS5odG1s)​

### 4 - Procrastination as Coping Strategy
- _Avoidance Coping;_ any strategy for managing a stressful situation in which a person does not address the problem directly but instead disengages from the situation and averts attention from it. In other words, the individual turns away from the processing of threatening information.
	- American Psychological Association, [_APA Dictionary of Psychology_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/75uxg65d5kh8hkv69ektz/owhkhqh4ppqxx2uq/aHR0cHM6Ly9kaWN0aW9uYXJ5LmFwYS5vcmcvYXZvaWRhbmNlLWNvcGluZw==)​

### 5 - Procrastination as Imbalance
You say, I must have rest. Assuredly; but nature appoints a measure for rest, just as for eating and drinking. In rest you go beyond these limits, and beyond what is enough; but in action you do not fill the measure, and remain well within your powers.
