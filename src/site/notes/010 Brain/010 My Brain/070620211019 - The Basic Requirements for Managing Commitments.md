# Outcome

Acquire a clearer definition of the outcome desired and the next action required.

# Why

Managing commitments well requires the implementation of some basic activities and behaviors:

-   **First of all, if it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear.** Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind, or what I call a collection bucket, that you know you'll come back to regularly and sort through.
-   **Second, you must clarify exactly what your commitment is** and decide what you have to do, if anything, to make progress toward fulfilling it.
-   Third, once you've decided on all the actions you need to take, **you must keep reminders** of them **organized in a system you review regularly**.

# Exercise

1.  **Write down the project or situation that is most on your mind at this moment.**
    -   What most "bugs" you, distracts you, or interests you, or in some other way consumes a large part of your conscious attention?
2.  **Describe, in a single written sentence, your intended successful outcome for this problem or situation.**
    -   "Take the Hawaii vacation," "Handle situation with customer X," "Resolve college situation with Susan," "Clarify new divisional management structure," or "Implement new investment strategy."
3.  **Now write down the very next physical action required to move the situation forward.**
    -   Would you pick up a phone and make a call? Go to your computer and write an e-mail? Sit down with pen and paper and brainstorm about it? Talk face-to-face with your spouse, your secretary, your attorney, or your boss? Buy nails at the hardware store?
