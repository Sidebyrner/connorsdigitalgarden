**Fredkin's paradox** concerns the negative [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation) between the difference between two options and the difficulty of [deciding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making) between them. Developed further, the paradox constitutes a major challenge to the possibility of pure [instrumental rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_rationality).

Proposed by [Edward Fredkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Fredkin), it reads: "The more equally attractive two alternatives seem, the harder it can be to choose between them—no matter that, to the same degree, the choice can only matter less."[1] Thus, a decision-making agent might spend the most time on the least important decisions.

An intuitive response to Fredkin's paradox is to calibrate decision-making time with the importance of the decision: to calculate the cost of optimizing into the optimization, a version of the [value of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information). However, this response is [self-referential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-referential) and spawns a new, recursive paradox: the decision-maker must now optimize the optimization of the optimization, and so on.[2]
