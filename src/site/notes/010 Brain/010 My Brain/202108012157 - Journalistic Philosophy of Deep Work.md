# Definition
You fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule

# Notes

-   For individuals that can shift into a writing mode on a moment's notice, as it required by the deadline-driven nature of the journalistic profession
-   Be confident in the value of what you're trying to produce

## Example

-   Take advantage of free stretches of time wherever they pop up.
    -   Kids taking a nap? Lock yourself in your office
    -   Wife takes kids out of town? Find a space in the house to write.
    -   Work meeting canceled? Retreat to the library for a few hundred words.
