# Definition
> For decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved

# Notes
-   For decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.
-   **The conscious mind** is like a home computer on which you can run carefully written programs that return correct answers to limited problems
-   **The unconscious mind** is like [[20220708 - Google\|20220708 - Google]]'s vast data centers in which statistical algorithms sift through unstructured information, teasing out surprising useful solutions to difficult questions.
-   Providing your **conscious mind** time to rest enables your **unconscious mind** to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges
