Second brain summit started as a January 2017 invitation from Toyota to deliver a workshop to 12 executives

### quote
- I sat down and spent 20 minutes searching through some of the relevant categories in my Second Brain. I looked at past presentations I’d given on the topic of Design Thinking and pulled out some slides I could reuse. I perused the notes on several books I’d read and extracted some key quotes. I found a collection of workshop exercises I’d borrowed from a friend and chose a few to add to our agenda.

- 20 minutes. That’s all it took to turn the corner on a project that itself would turn the corner on my career. 20 minutes to access the accumulated knowledge of almost 10 years of reading and watching videos and listening to podcasts and audiobooks that I _would have read and listened to anyway_.
