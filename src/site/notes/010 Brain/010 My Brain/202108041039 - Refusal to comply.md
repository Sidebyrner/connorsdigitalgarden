## Refusal to comply (ref: [[202108041015 - When is mutiny in order?\|202108041015 - When is mutiny in order?]])
Here are some possible outcomes when the subordinate refuses to comply:
1. The leader recognizes that the subordinate is extremely concerned about the plan - so concerned that they are putting their career at stake and ricking the possible punitive actions â€” because it is actually really bad. 
2. The leader digs in even deeper and will not change the plan. Since the subordinate has refused to participate, the leader fires the subordinate and puts a new subordinate in place who has been hand-picked for unquestioning obedience. For the boss, the problem is solved, but the team will absolutely suffer now since the voice of reason has been replaced by one of the boss's [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202108012048 - Yes Men\|202108012048 - Yes Men]].
3. If a subordinate draws a line is the sand and refuses to execute a plan or outright quits the position as a protest, they instantly remove all influence of any kind over the boss. Once the statement has been made, there is nothing else they can do.
4. If the subordinate tries every possible method to convince the boss that plan is wrong, and sees no way of changing the boss's mind, then perhaps the better option is for the subordinate to make one last statement of concern and then proceed to lead the team in the evacuation of the plan to the best of their ability.
