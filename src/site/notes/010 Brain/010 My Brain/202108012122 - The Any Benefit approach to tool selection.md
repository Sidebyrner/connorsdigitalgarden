# Definition
You're justified in using a network tool if you can identify _any_ possible benefit to its use, or _anything_ you might possibly miss out on if you don't use it.

-   The notion that identifying _some_ benefit is sufficient to invest money, time, and attention
-   Identifies any potential positive impact as justification for using a tool
-   **ignores the negatives** that come along with the tools in question
-   Network tools are not exceptional; they're tools, no different from a blacksmith's hammer or an artists's brush, used by skilled laborers to do their jobs better
