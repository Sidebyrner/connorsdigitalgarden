1.    
    Try changing things — do your best to change your current situation so your work gives you what you need — satisfaction, challenges, and/or money (I did that 🥳).
    

ℹ️ this happens by talking to people. I didn't do enough of this 😢

2. Negotiate terms — find who you depend on and negotiate terms. Be ruthless. You are giving value to your company, and you deserve your company to take care of you. But you need to negotiate to make the terms clear and to improve them — no one will do it for you.

3. Fill your time with things that grow you — how you spend your days is how you live your life. Don't let yourself do nothing. Or you will fall in a hole you'll years to dig yourself out of.

4. Change your company — don't settle. Job hunting is hard as hell, but you can do it. Improve your CV, work on your communication skills — you can do it!

5. Build your own business — alternatively, don't quit and spend all of your time & energy on building your own company. You'll learn a lot and grow a lot. Even if it doesn't work.

Again, and I can't say this enough times — talk to people. Your communication will build your network. Your network is your net worth. In any company and outside.
