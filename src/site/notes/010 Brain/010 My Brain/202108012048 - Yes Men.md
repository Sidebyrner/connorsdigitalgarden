# Definition
> Some leaders would rather just have their subordinates do exactly what they are told to do. That is a bad idea.

You want a subordinate who has the confidence and the trust in me to say, "Boss, that isn't a good idea (For x, y, and/or z reason)."

-   Encourage the rest of your team to think and to question you. Don't surround yourself with Yes-men. They do nothing to help you or the team. And if it makes you uncomfortable to get pushback or questions from your team, check your ego [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202107281009 - Subordinate your ego\|202107281009 - Subordinate your ego]]; it is probably a little inflated.
