Grace Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States Navy Rear Admiral. She is best known as the creator of [[COBOL: Common Business-Oriented Language\|COBOL: Common Business-Oriented Language]], a pioneering programming language that revolutionized data processing and business applications. Hopper also invented the [[compiler\|compiler]], a groundbreaking tool that translated human-readable programming instructions into machine code.

### Early Life and Education
Hopper earned her bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from [[Vassar College\|Vassar College]] in 1928, followed by a master's degree (1930) and Ph.D. (1934) in mathematics from [[Yale University\|Yale University]]. She began her professional career teaching mathematics at [[Vassar College\|Vassar College]] but shifted her focus during World War II by joining the [[U.S. Navy Reserve\|U.S. Navy Reserve]].

### Career Highlights
- **Mark I Computer**: Hopper's first assignment was at [[Harvard University\|Harvard University]], where she worked on the [[Mark I\|Mark I]], the first large-scale automatic calculator and precursor to modern computers. She later contributed to the development of [[Mark II\|Mark II]] and [[Mark III\|Mark III]].
- **UNIVAC I**: In 1949, Hopper joined the [[Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation\|Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation]], where she worked on the development of [[UNIVAC I\|UNIVAC I]], the first commercial electronic computer.
- **Compiler Innovation**: In 1952, Hopper created the first [[compiler\|compiler]], the [[A-0 System\|A-0 System]], which made programming more accessible by translating instructions into machine code. This innovation laid the foundation for machine-independent programming languages.
- **FLOW-MATIC and COBOL**: Hopper developed [[FLOW-MATIC\|FLOW-MATIC]], an English-like programming language that inspired the creation of [[COBOL\|COBOL]] in 1959. [[COBOL\|COBOL]] became one of the most widely used languages for business applications.

### Military Achievements
Hopper retired from the Navy in 1966 but was recalled to active duty in 1967 to standardize computer languages for military applications. She was promoted to Commodore in 1983, a rank later incorporated into Rear Admiral in 1985. At the time of her final retirement in 1986, Hopper was the oldest active-duty officer in the [[U.S. Navy\|U.S. Navy]].

### Legacy and Honors
Hopper received numerous accolades throughout her lifetime, including:
- The [[National Medal of Technology\|National Medal of Technology]] in 1991 for her pioneering contributions to computer science.
- Posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom\|Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Barack Obama\|Barack Obama]] in 2016.
- Namesakes such as the guided-missile destroyer [[USS Hopper\|USS Hopper]], [[Yale University\|Yale University]]'s [[Hopper College\|Hopper College]], and Nvidia's [[Hopper\|Hopper]] GPU architecture honor her legacy.

Grace Hopper’s work continues to inspire generations of programmers and engineers. Her belief that programming should be simple and accessible transformed computing forever, making her a true trailblazer in technology and innovation.
