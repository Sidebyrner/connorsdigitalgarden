The definition of the specifications which the answer to the problem had to satisfy, that is, of the "boundary conditions."
	1. Clear specifications as to what the decision has to accomplish
		1. The more concisely and clearly boundary conditions are stated, the greater likelihood that the decisions will indeed be an effective one and will accomplish what it set out to do.
		2. **Boundary conditions:** "What is the minimum needed to resolve this problem?"
		3. The effective executive knows that a decision that does not satisfy the boundary conditions is ineffectual and inappropriate
		4. Defining the specifications and setting the boundary conditions cannot be done on the "facts" in any decision of importance. It always has to be done on interpretations. **_It is a risk-taking judgment_**
		
- If one does not know what is right to satisfy the specifications and boundary conditions, one cannot distinguish between the right compromise and the wrong compromise-and will end up making the wrong compromise.
