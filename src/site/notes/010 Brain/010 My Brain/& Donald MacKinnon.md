His work at Station S laid the foundation for modern personality assessment techniques. In 1947, he joined UC Berkeley and, in 1949, founded the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research (IPAR), where he conducted groundbreaking studies on creativity and personality until his retirement in 1970[1][3][5].

MacKinnon's research focused on understanding creativity through rigorous scientific methods. At IPAR, he led studies involving prominent writers, scientists, and architects to identify traits associated with creative individuals. His findings challenged stereotypes, showing that creative thinkers often displayed qualities like independence, self-awareness, and a balance of introversion and extroversion. Notable works include his 1948 report "Assessment of Men" and his 1978 book *[[{ In Search of Human Effectiveness\|{ In Search of Human Effectiveness]]*. MacKinnon also served as president of the Division of Personality and Social Psychology and the Western Psychological Association, earning recognition such as the [[202504071153 - Murray Award\|202504071153 - Murray Award]] for his contributions to personality research[1][2][5].
