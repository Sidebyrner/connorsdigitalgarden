# Definition
Tools are ultimately aids to the larger goal of one's craft

-   Identify the core factors that determined success and happiness in your personal and professional life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts
-   Requires that these positive impacts affect factors at the core of what's important to you and that they **outweigh the negatives.**
