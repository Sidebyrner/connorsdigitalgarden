## Deep work is meaningful
### Deep work helps you produce at an elite level
#### page 39: Batching work
{ #27ccdc}


- Though [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/& Adam Grant\|& Adam Grant]]'s productivity depends on many factors, there's one idea in particular that seems central to his method: the batching of hard by important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches.
{ #c9cddd}

	- Within the year, he stacks his teaching into the fall semester, during which he turns all his attention to teaching.
	- By batching his teaching in the fall, Grant can then turn his attention fully to research in the spring and summer, and tackle this work with less distraction.
	- Within a semester dedicated to research, he alternates between periods where his door is open to students and  colleagues and periods where he isolates himself to focus completely and without distraction on a single research task. 

#### page 42-44
##### [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202108011458 - Attention residue\|202108011458 - Attention residue]]
> "People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task," and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance.
- To produce at your peak level, you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.
- **The type of work that optimizes your performance is Deep Work**

#### page 48
> Unless you have strong evidence that distraction is important for your specific profession, you're best served by giving serious consideration to depth.

**High-Quality Work Produced = (Time spent) x (Intensity of focus)**
### A Neurological Argument for Depth
#### page 81
-	The habit of frequently checking inboxes ensures that shallow concerns remain at the forefront of attention...it ensures that your mind will construct an understanding of your working life that's dominated by stress, irritation, frustration, and triviality. [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202108011507 - Busyness as Proxy for Productivity\|202108011507 - Busyness as Proxy for Productivity]]

### A Psychological Argument for Depth
#### page 84
##### Flow state
Studies conducted by: 
[[& Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\|& Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]
[[& Winifred Gallagher\|& Winifred Gallagher]] - [[{ Rapt}\|{ Rapt}]]

> Ghallager reports, "when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what's right."
Most people assumed that relaxation makes them happy. But the results from Csikszentmihalyi's electronic sampling method (ESM) studies reveal that most people have this wrong
	> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.
	-		[[& Winifred Gallagher\|& Winifred Gallagher]]: The content of what we focus on matters. If we give rapt attention to important things, and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we'll experience out working life as more important and positive. 
			**vs.**
	-		[[& Mihhaly Csikszentmihalyi\|& Mihhaly Csikszentmihalyi]]: The feeling of going deep is _in itself_ very rewarding
	-		Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state
	-		The act of going deep orders the consciousness in a way that makes life worthwhile
	it's even more important that the _individual_ learn how to seek out opportunities for flow
- To build your working life around the experience of flow produced. by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction

### A Philosophical Argument for Depth
#### page 88
- The craftsman has stumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of meaning site outside the individual
- The task of a craftsman "is not to _generate_ meaning, but rather to _cultivate_ in himself the skill of _discerning_ the meanings that are _already there_."
- Any pursuit — be it physical or cognitive—that supports high levels of skill can also generate a sense of sacredness.
- Whether you're a writer, marketer, consultant, or lawyer: Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life.
- You don't need a rarified job; you **need instead a rarified approach to your work**


Our current conversation on these topics seems to imply that "the medium is morality" [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202107301018 - Intellectual Ethic\|202107301018 - Intellectual Ethic]] either you're on board with the Facebook future or see it as our downfall.

-   A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it's not a philosophical statement - it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done

## Rules of Deep Work
### Rule 1: Work Deeply

-   **Deep Work Depth Philosophies**
    -   [Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work]
    -   [Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work]
    -   [Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work]
    -   [Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work]

> "You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it" 
— [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/& Roy Baumeister\|& Roy Baumeister]]

Your will is not a manifestation of your character that you can deploy without limit; it's instead like a muscle that tires

-   **Ritualize**
    
    > Rituals minimize the friction in the transition to depth
   
-   Where you work and for how long
-   How you'll work once you start to work
-   How you'll support your work
    
    > Waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to **ignore inspiration**  
    — Mason Currey
    
	- Charles Darwin had a strict structure for his working life during the period when he was perfecting _On the Origin of Species_. He would ride promptly at 7 am to take a short walk. He would eat breakfast alone and retire to his study from 8 until 9:30. The next hour was dedicated to reading his letters from the day before, after which he would return to his study from 10:30 until Noon. After this session, he would mull over challenging ideas while walking a prescribed route on his property. He would walk until satisfied with his thinking, then **declare his work day done".** (p. 118)
    

-   **Make Grand Gestures**
    
    -   By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.
    -   These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. **Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.**
    
    ### Examples
    
    -   Bill Gates' "Think Weeks" at his cabin in the middle of nowhere.
        
{ #d68821}

    -   J.K. Rowling checking into the Balmoral Hotel for $5,000 a night to finish _The Deathly Hallows_
        
    -   Peter Shankman buying a round-trip ticket to Tokyo in business class to write a book.
        
        > The Trip was $4,000 and it was worth every penny
        
-   **Don't Work Alone**
    
    -   Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.
    -   **Guidelines**
    -   the **_theory of serendipitous creativity_**
    -   Building 20 at MIT
    -   [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/20210261234 - The Whiteboard Effect\|20210261234 - The Whiteboard Effect]]
    -   Execute Like a Business
-   **Be Lazy**
    
    > Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as indispensable to the brain as Vitamin D is to the body, and deprived of it we suffer a mental affliction as disfiguring as rickets...it is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.
    
    — Tim Kreider
    
    At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning
    
    -   Reason #1: Downtime aids insights
    -   Reason #2: Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply

### Rule 2: Embrace Boredom

The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained

-   Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean you mind from a dependence on distraction.
    
    -   You'll struggle to achieve the deepest level so concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.
    
    > People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy. They can't manage a working memory. They're chronically distracted - they're pretty much mental wrecks. —   Clifford Nass
    
    When asked whether the chronically distracted recognize this rewiring of the brain:
    
    > Unfortunately, people developed habits of mind that make it impossible for them to be laser focused. (how can [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/{ The Shallows - What the Internet is doing to our brains\|{ The Shallows - What the Internet is doing to our brains]] help to mitigate the consequences of this finding?)
    
    Once you brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, it's hard to shake that addiction even when you _want_ to concentrate.
    
    -   If every moment of potential boredom in you life - say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives - is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where it's not ready for deep work - even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.
-   Strategy: Schedule _Internet blocks_ and _offline blocks_
    
    Schedule in advance when you'll use the internet, and then avoid it altogether outside of the these times.
    
    -   The constant _switching_ from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities that teach your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.
    -   Constant switching can be understood as weakening the mental muscles responsible for organizing the many sources vying for your attention.
    -   1.  Jobs that requires a lot of time online can still use this strategy
    -   2.  Regardless of how you schedule your _Internet blocks_, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet Use.
    -   3.  Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training
-   Work like Teddy Roosevelt
    
    -   Roosevelt would begin his scheduling by considering the 8 hours from eight a.m. to four thirty p.m. He would then remove the time spent in recitation and classes , this athletic training, and lunch. The fragments left were then considered time dedicated exclusively to studying.
    
    > The amount of time he spent at his desk was comparatively small, but his concentration was so intense, and his reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off than most.
    
    -   Edmund Morris, biographer
        
    -  [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202108012131 - Roosevelt Dash\|202108012131 - Roosevelt Dash]]
        
-   Meditate Productively
    
    **Productive meditation:** take a period in which you're occupied physically but not mentally - walking, jogging, driving, showering - and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem
    
    -   Resists distraction, forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper on a single problem
    -   Suggestion 1: Be wary of distractions and looping
    -   Suggestion 2: Structure your deep thinking
    -   A side effect of memory training is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate.

### Rule 3: Quit Social Media

-   **Main point**: Network tools fragment our time and reduce or ability to concentrate
    
-   **Second point:** The impotence (helplessness) with which knowledge workers currently discuss the problem of network tools and attention
    
    -   Accept your current distracted state as inevitable
-   **Alternative:** These tools are not inherently evil, and that some of them might be quite vital to your success and happiness
    
    -   at the same time also accepting that the threshold for allowing a site to regularly access your time and attention should be much more stringent
    -   **conclusion:** most people should be using fewer such tools
    -   There is a middle ground in this debate, and if you're interested in developing a deep work habit, you must fight to get there
-   [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202108012122 - The Any Benefit approach to tool selection\|202108012122 - The Any Benefit approach to tool selection]]
    
    > The notion that identifying _some_ benefit is sufficient to invest money, time, and attention
    
    -   You're justified in using a network tool if you can identify _any_ possible benefit to its use, or _anything_ you might possibly miss out on if you don't use it.
    -   Identifies any potential positive impact as justification for using a tool
    -   **ignores the negatives** that come along with the tools in question
    -   Network tools are not exceptional; they're tools, no different from a blacksmith's hammer or an artists's brush, used by skilled laborers to do their jobs better
-   [The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection]
    
    Tools are ultimately aids to the larger goal of one's craft
    
    -   Identify the core factors that determind success and happiness in your personal and professional life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts
    -   Requires that these positive impacts affect factors at the core of what's important to you and that they **outweigh the negatives.**
-   **Apply [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202108012141 - The Law of the Vital Few\|202108012141 - The Law of the Vital Few]] (80/20) to your internet habits**
    
    In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes
    
    -   [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/& Malcom Gladwell\|010 My Brain/& Malcom Gladwell]], Michael Lewis, George Packer don't use twitter
        
        -   They don't feel like the service offers them nearly enough advantages to offset its negatives in their particular circumstances
            
            > It's amazing how overly accessible people are — Michael Lewis
            
    -   Process
        
    -   Example (how can this process be improved using the strategies found in [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/{  Atomic Habits\|{  Atomic Habits]]
        
    -   If you service low-impact activities, you're taking away time you could be spending on higher-impact activities
        
    
    Take care in deciding which tools you allow to claim your own limited time and attention
    
    How can I replicate this practice as an exercise for personal objectives?
    
-   **Quit Social Media**
    
    By dropping off these services without notice, you can test the reality of your status as a content producer.
    
    For most people and most services, the news might be sobering - no one outside your closest friends and family will likely even notice you've signed off.
    
    Stop using social media for 30 days, cold turkey
    
    -   After 30 days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit:
        
        1.  Would the last thirty days have been notable better if I had been able to use this service?
        2.  Did people care that I wasn't using this service?
        
        -   If your answer is "no" to both questions: **Quit the service permanently.**
        -   If your answer was a clear "yes," then **return to using the service.**
    
    > These services, if used without limit, can be particularly devastating to your quest to work deeper.
    
    Part of what makes social media insidious is that the companies that profit from your attention have succeed with a masterful marketing coup: **convincing our culture that if you don't use their products, you might** **_miss out._**
    
    -   Social media's rapid ascent has replaced this timeless capitalist exchange with a shallow collective alternative: _I'll pay attention to what you have to say if you pay attention to what I say - regardless of its value._
        -   The implicit agreement motivating this behavior is that in return for receiving attention from your friends and followers, you'll return the favor by lavishing attention on them.
        -   _You "like" my status update and I'll "like" yours_
    -   These services are just products, developed by private companies, funded lavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture then sell your personal information and attention to advertisers.
-   **Don't use the internet to entertain yourself**
    
    > (the typical man) persists in looking upon those hours from 10 to 6 as 'the day,' to which the ten hours preceding them and the 6 hours following them are nothing but a prologue and epilogue
    
    — [[& Arnold Bennett\|& Arnold Bennett]] [[{ How to Live on 24 hours a day\|{ How to Live on 24 hours a day]] 
    
    -   You both _should_ and _can_ make deliberate use of your time outside of work
    -   Put more thought into your leisure time
    
    > You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm and a leg. All they want is change - not rest, except to sleep.
    
    -   if you give your mind something meaningful to do through _all_ your waking hours, you'll end the day more fulfilled, and begin to the next one more relaxed
    -   Eliminate the addictive pull of entertainment sites on your time and attention, give your brain a quality alternative.

### Rule 4: Drain the Shallows

> Very few people work even 8 hours a day. You're lucky if you get a few good hours in between all the meetings, interruptions, web surfing, office politics, and personal business that permeate the typical workday Fewer official working hours help squeeze the fat out of the typical workweek. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done, they respect that time even more. People become stingy with their time and that's a good thing. They don't waste it on things that just don't matter. When you have fewer hours you usually spend them more wisely

— Jason Fried, Basecamp co-founder

If you not only eliminate shallow work, but also replace this recovered time with more of the deep alternative, not only will the business continue to function; it can become _more_ successful.

-   We should see the goal of Draining the Shallows as **taming** shallow work's footprint in your schedule, not **eliminating** it.
    
    -   The implication deep work as a limited resource is that once you're hit your deep work limit in a given day, you'll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more.
        -   The typical workday is 8 hours - the most adept deep worker cannot spend more than 4 hours in a state of true depth.
    -   treat shallow work with suspicion. You must keep it confined to a point where it don't impede your ability to take full advantage of the deeper efforts that ultimately determine your impact.
-   **Schedule every minute of your day**
    
    At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours you typically work.
    
    Divide the hours of your workday into _blocks_. Minimum length is 30 minutes (one line on your page). Batch similar things into more generic task blocks
    
    Give every minute of your workday a job
    
    -   Strategies
-   **Quantify the depth of every activity**
    
    How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?
    
    -   If our hypothetical college graduate requires many months of training to replicate a task, then this indicates that the task leverages hard-won expertise
    -   A task that our hypothetical college graduate can pick up quickly is one that does not leverage expertise, and therefore it can be understood as shallow
-   **Ask your boss for a shallow work budget (counterpoint:** [[Conform to Influence\|Conform to Influence]]
    
    What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?
    
    -   If you work for someone else this strategy provides cover when you turn down an obligation or restructure a project to minimize shallowness.
    -   You can justify the move because it's necessary for you to hit your prescribed target mix of work types
    -   By giving your boss a clear economic reality that will lead to the natural conclusion that you _need_ to say no to some things and to streamline others -
    -   If you work for yourself, this exercise will force you to confront the reality of how little time in your "busy" schedule you're actually producing value
    -   By picking and sticking with the shallow-to-deep ratio, you can replace this guilt-driven unconditional acceptance with the more healthy habit of tryi g to get the most out of the time you put aside for shallow work - therefore still exposing yourself to many opportunities - but keeping these efforts constrained to a small enough fraction of your time and attention and to enable the deep work that ultimately drives your business forward.
    -   Cause for concern
-   **Finish your work by 5:30**
    A meta-habit that's simple to adopt but broad in its impact
    -   Fix-schedule productivity, fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration.
    -   One of the main techniques for respecting an hour limit was to set drastic quotes on the major sources of _shallow_ endeavors
    -   Ruthlessly cap the shallow while protecting deep efforts
    -   Be clear in refusal of obligation and ambiguous in explanation of the refusal
        -   This strategy frees up out time without diminishing the amount of new value we generate.
        -   The reduction in shallow frees up more energy for the deep alternative
        -   The limits to our time necessitate more careful thinking about our organizational habits
    -   **Become Hard to Reach**
