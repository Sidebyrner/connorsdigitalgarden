# The Method Broken Down
1.  A project is “a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.”
2.  An area **PERSONALLY RELEVANT** of responsibility is “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.
    1.  **Areas of Responsibility are:**
        1.  the roles you take on in life and the hats you wear
            1.  (Spouse, Mother/Father, Team Leader, Soccer Coach)
        2.  The ongoing standards where the buck stops with you
            1.  (Product Development, Company Newsletter, Legal),
        3.  things that take a certain amount of constant attention
            1.  (Exercise, Finances, Apartment, Pets)
3.  A resource **GENERALLY USEFUL** is “a topic or theme of ongoing interest.
    1.  **Resources are:
        1.  interests
            1.  (web design, crowdfunding, woodworking, frisbee golf, bio-hacking)
        2.  themes
            1.  (psychology, politics, leadership, integrity)
        3.  assets
            1.  (stock photos, typography links, marketing swipe file, product testimonials, code snippets)
4. **Archives** include “inactive items from the other three categories.”
