# Determinism

-   Technological progress, which is seen as an autonomous force outside man's control, has been the primary factor influencing the course of human history

# Instrumentalism

-   Downplay the power of technology, believing tools to be neutral artifacts, entirely subservient to the conscious wishes of their users
-   Our instruments are the means we use to achieve our ends; they have no ends of their own

> Progress has its own logic, which is not always consistent with the intentions or wishes of the toolmakers and tool users.

-   Sometimes our tools do what we tell them to do. Other times, we adapt ourselves to our tools' requirements
