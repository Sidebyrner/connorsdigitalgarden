_The Odyssey Plan,_ a method to help navigate [big decisions](https://aliabdaal.com/climbing-a-mountain/), and to answer the age-old question of **"What should I do with my life?"** It goes as follows:

1.  Write out, in detail, what your life would look like 5 years from now if you continued down your current path.
2.  Write out, in detail, what your life would look like 5 years from now if you took a completely different path.
3.  Write out, in detail, what your life would look like 5 years from now if money and social obligations were irrelevant.
