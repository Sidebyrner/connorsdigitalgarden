# Steps to take
1.  Focus on the wildly important (ref. [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202108012054 - Prioritize and Execute\|202108012054 - Prioritize and Execute]]
    
    1.  Having a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits will generate a steadier stream of enthusiasm
2.  Act on the Lead Measures
    
    1.  **Lag measures:** describe the thing that you're ultimately trying to improve
    2.  **Lead Measures:** Measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the **lag measures**
    
# Examples
        -   **Bakery Business**
            
            -   **Goal:** Increase customer satisfaction
                -   **Lag measure:** customer satisfaction scores
                -   **Lead Measure:** The number of customers who receive free samples
                    -   This is a number you can directly increase, affecting your lag measure (improve or not).
        -   **Personal**
            
            Lead Measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward you wildly important goal
            
            Lag Measure: Number of papers published
            
3.  Keep a compelling scoreboard
    
    1.  Track the amount of deep work hours on a scorecard
        1.  Each week has a row. Try to beat last week's tally
        2.  Circle tally mark when reaching an important milestone
4.  Create a cadence of accountability
    
    1.  "Weekly review" to look over Deep Work scorecard
    2.  The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult that strategizing
