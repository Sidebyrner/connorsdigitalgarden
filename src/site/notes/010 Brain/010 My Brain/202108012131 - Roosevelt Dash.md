# How to perform a dash
1.  Identify a deep task (something that requires deep work to complete) high on your priority list.
2.  Estimate how long you'd normally put aside for an obligation of this type
3.  Give yourself a herd deadline that _drastically reduces_ this time.

-   Attack this task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.
