# definition
Attention residue: When you switch from Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn't immediately follow - a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task

> "People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task."
**â€” Sophie Leroy, business professor at University of Minnesota**
