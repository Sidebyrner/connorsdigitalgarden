1.  "The relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment: A meta-analysis" by R.M. Steers and L.W. Porter (1983): This meta-analysis examined the results of 72 studies and found that there is a strong positive relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The study also found that job satisfaction is a better predictor of organizational commitment than other job attitudes, such as job involvement and job importance.
    
2.  "The role of affect in the relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment" by T.W. Lee and M.M. Mitchell (1994): This study examined the role of affective experiences (such as emotions and moods) in the relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The study found that affective experiences are important mediators in this relationship, and that individuals who experience positive affective states are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and more committed to their organizations.
    
3.  "The relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment in the context of organizational change" by A.M. Saks and S.J. Ashforth (1997): This study examined the relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment in the context of organizational change. The study found that individuals who are satisfied with their jobs are more likely to be committed to their organizations, but that this relationship is stronger when organizational change is perceived as positive.
    
4.  "The relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment: A study of professionals" by L.M. Shore, C.A. Barksdale, and D.C. Taylor (1999): This study examined the relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment among a sample of professionals. The study found that job satisfaction was positively related to organizational commitment, but that other factors such as salary and promotion opportunities were also important predictors of commitment.
