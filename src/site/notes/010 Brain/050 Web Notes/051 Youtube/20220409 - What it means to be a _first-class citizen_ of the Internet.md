## Notes
### Human Society Has Gone Virtual
- Offline is coming online
- online is the primary place where vibrant communities grow
- AND where more *work* is being done
### Is virtual. "bad"?
- it seems like people don't care about each other
- it's only bad if you are not a part of it
	- if you embrance the online world and find your place on it, it is your space to create your own renaissance
	- You can build anything you can imaginge - *but you need a certain type of skills to be successful*
### If you don't develop your skills, you will be left behind
- **What it means to be a first class citizen:** you see the internet as a welcoming powerful, abundant place
### You know how to access information and not be overwhelmed by the volume of information available.
> This is how the overabundance of information and choices leads to Information Overload:

1.  You feel like you have **too much information to hold in your head** at once.
2.  You consume a lot of valuable information, but it **isn’t** **translating into results**.
3.  You feel **starved for a sense of completion**, constantly starting things but not finishing them.
4.  You struggle to get into a state of flow because you’re **switching back and forth between competing priorities**.
5.  You find yourself lowering your goals and ambitions because you’re **not confident you can follow through on them**.
6.  You frequently **hesitate, doubt, or overthink** what you should do next, instead of just taking action.
7.  You feel like the notes you take or the information you collect just **go into an “idea graveyard”** instead of being put to use.
8.  You may even feel a **sense of hopelessness,** wondering if you’ll ever be able to accomplish your most important goals, amidst all the competing obligations that life throws at you.
- connect to online communities that help you be the person you want to be

*Thrive here, not by brute force, but by being part of online communities*
