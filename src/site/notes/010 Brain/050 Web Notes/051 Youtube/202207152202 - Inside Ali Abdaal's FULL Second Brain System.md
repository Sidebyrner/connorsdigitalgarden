# C.O.D.E
## Capture
### Notes
- Physical journal notes
	- Morning Pages
- Apple Notes
	- good for offline
- "Readwise is the center of my capture system"
	- I take notes in Kindle and it sends straight to Readwise
	- Articles on Instapaper go to Readwise
		- #comment Raindrop.io a good substitute for this
- ROAM research
	- #comment it looks like Ali is using ROAM much like I use obsidian
- Notion
	- Anything business/company oriented gets captured and organized in notion
### Tasks
- ToDoist
- Voice Memo
- Otter.ai
	- a transcription app
- cleanshot.io
	- turn screenshot videos into gifs
- "What is the unit of output that I care about?"
	- Then let's just do whatever it takes to get to that as efficiently as possible
	- Don't be wed to the organization of the system
## Organize
- a lot of capture sources are organize sources
	- Notion, ROAM, and Apple notes
- Sometimes Apple Notes is unorganized or unfiltered (long inbox of items)
	- "Let chaos reign, then rein in the chaos" - [[& Andy Grove\|& Andy Grove]]
## Distill
Heigharchy
1. First Brain: 
	1. What can I come up with on my own
2. Second Brain:
	1. What material that I have captured in the past can I use to answer this question?
3. *Optional* The Internet:
	1. Use this as little as possible.
	2. **in fact,** try using what you have (your brains) before going to this medium. The content you search for is not well refined, nor is it time effective
## Express
### Apple Notes
- Apple Notes vs. Roam
	- All the friction of Roam is more annoying than writing in a plain, simple notes app
	- Just need to converge or sprint towards a conclusion of an answer to an idea
- Apple notes a landing space for information found in a research app just as ROAM or obsidian
