He had been monitoring the rapid growth of a new social messaging product called Kik, which was especially popular among young people. He decided that Tencent needed to create its own social messenger for smartphonesâ€”and quickly. Zhangâ€™s proposal represented not only a huge opportunity but also a huge risk, with equally huge uncertainty about the outcome. While a new messenger service might appeal to young consumers, it was probably going to cannibalize QQ, which was, after all, Tencentâ€™s core business. Furthermore, Tencent had partnered with leading mobile carriers like China Mobile to receive 40Â percent of the SMS charges that QQ users racked up when they sent messages to mobile phones. A new service could hurt Tencentâ€™s financial bottom line and at the same time risk its relationships with some of Chinaâ€™s most powerful companies. It was the sort of decision that publicly traded, ten-thousand-person companies typically refer to a committee for further study. But Ma wasnâ€™t a typical corporate executive. That very night, he gave Zhang the go-ahead to pursue the idea. Zhang put together a ten-person team, including seven engineers, to build and launch the new product. In just two months, Zhangâ€™s small team had built a mobile-first social messaging network with a clean, minimalistic design that was the polar opposite of QQ. Ma named the service Weixin, which means â€œmicromessageâ€ in Mandarin. Outside of China, the service became known as WeChat. — location: [217]()

In a 2004 working paper, â€œSchumpeterian Profits in the American Economy: Theory and Measurement,â€ Yale economist William Nordhaus examined the US economy from 1948 to 2001. Based on the data he collected, he concluded that only 2.2Â percent of â€œprofits that arise when firms are able to appropriate the returns from innovative activityâ€ went to the disrupters. â€œMost of the benefits of technological change are passed on to consumers rather than captured by producers,â€ he concluded. — location: [306]()

So what secret alchemy is at work in Silicon Valley to fuel such rapid-fire growth of so many of the worldâ€™s most valuable tech companies? And if there is a secret, can it be identified, analyzed, understood, and, most important, applied elsewhere? Blitzscaling is that secret.

It also requires an environment that is willing to finance intelligent risks with both financial capital and human capital, which are the essential ingredients for blitzscaling. Think of them as fuel and oxygen; you need both to propel the rocket skyward. Meanwhile, the infrastructure of your organization is the actual structure of your rocket, which youâ€™re rebuilding on the fly as you rise. Your job as a leader and an entrepreneur is to make sure that you have sufficient fuel to propel your growth while making the necessary mechanical adjustments to the actual rocket ship to keep it from flying apart as it accelerates. — location: [469]()

Fortunately, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made two important moves: he personally led a shift from desktop-first to mobile-first, and he hired Sheryl Sandberg as the companyâ€™s COO, who in turn built Facebook into an advertising sales juggernaut. Growth rose back into the triple-digit range, and, by 2010, these moves had pushed Facebookâ€™s revenues to over $2Â billion. Weâ€™ll examine both of these key moves in greater detail later in the book, with Facebookâ€™s shift to mobile featured in our analysis of Facebookâ€™s business model, and Facebookâ€™s hiring of Sheryl Sandberg in the section on the key transition from contributors to managers to executives. — location: [549]()

On offense, blitzscaling allows you to do several things. First, you can take the market by surprise, bypassing heavily defended niches to exploit breakout opportunities. — location: [570]()
{ #ref-2778}


---
Second, you can leverage your lead to build long-term competitive advantages before other players are able to respond. — location: [572]()
{ #ref-64750}

Third, blitzscaling opens up access to capital, because investors generally prefer to back market leaders. You can win this mantle if you blitzscale, and with it raise more money more easily and more quickly than your lagging competitors. — location: [573]()
{ #ref-13682}


---
On defense, blitzscaling lets you set a pace that keeps your competitors gasping simply to keep up, affording them little time and space to counterattack. Because theyâ€™re focused on responding to your moves, which can often take them by surprise and force them to play catch-up, they donâ€™t have as much time available to develop and execute differentiated strategies that might threaten your position. — location: [576]()

Scale-up employees are paid market salaries, receive equity upside, and have a very good chance of becoming rich, if not filthy rich. By attracting the best people, scale-ups increase their ability to build and bring to market great products, which in turn increases their ability to rapidly scale. — location: [592]()

Consider the case of two very similar companies, Twitter and Tumblr. Both had brilliant, product-oriented founders in Evan â€œEvâ€ Williams and David Karp. Both were hot social media start-ups. Both grew at a remarkable rate after establishing product/market fit. Both had a major impact on popular culture. Yet Twitter went public and achieved a market capitalization that peaked at nearly $37Â billion, while Tumblr was acquired by Yahoo!â€”another start-up that used blitzscaling to become a scale-up, only to decline and fade awayâ€”for â€œonlyâ€ $1Â billion. — location: [603]()

Successful blitzscaling means that youâ€™re maintaining at least some level of control by rapidly fixing the things that will inevitably get broken so that the company can maintain its furious pace without flaming out or collapsing in on itself — location: [629]()

THE FIVE STAGES OF BLITZSCALING Â  Stage 1 (Family) 1â€“9 employees Stage 2 (Tribe) 10s of employees Stage 3 (Village) 100s of employees Stage 4 (City) 1000s of employees Stage 5 (Nation) 10000s of employees — location: [656]()

Some of the other measures of scale include the number of users (user scale), the number of customers (customer scale), and total annual revenues (business scale). These measures usually, but donâ€™t always, move in lockstep. — location: [675]()
{ #ref-25730}


---
When a business can grow users, customers, and revenues faster than the number of employees without collapsing under the weight of its own growth, the business can achieve greater profitability and keep growing without being as tightly constrained by the need for financial or human capital. — location: [682]()
{ #ref-22463}


---
The first technique of blitzscaling is to design an innovative business model that can truly grow. This sounds like a Start-ups 101â€“level insight, but itâ€™s astounding how many founders miss this key element. A major mistake made by many start-ups around the world is focusing on the technology, the software, the product, and the design, but neglecting to ever figure out the business. — location: [695]()

At Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin built great search algorithms, but it was their innovations to the search engine business modelâ€”specifically, considering relevance and performance when displaying advertisements rather than simply renting space to the highest bidderâ€”that drove their massive success. — location: [700]()

---
The key is to combine new technologies with effective distribution to potential customers, a scalable and high-margin revenue model, and an approach that allows you to serve those customers given your probable resource constraints. — location: [730]()

The most obvious element of blitzscaling is the pursuit of extreme growth, which, when combined with an innovative business model, can generate massive value and long-term competitive advantage. — location: [749]()
{ #ref-30412}

Achieving 20Â percent annual growth, which would delight Wall Street analysts covering any other industry, simply isnâ€™t enough to transform a start-up into a multibillion-dollar company fast enough. Silicon Valley venture capitalists want entrepreneurs to pursue exponential growth even if doing so costs more money and increases the chances that the business could fail, resulting in a bigger loss. Dropping below even 40Â percent annual growth is a warning sign for investors. — location: [773]()
{ #ref-33975}


---
Because blitzscaling often requires spending significant amounts of capital in ways that traditional business wisdom would consider â€œwasteful,â€ implementing a financial strategy that supports this aggressive spending is a critical part of blitzscaling. For example, Uber often uses heavy subsidies on both sides of the marketplace when it launches in a new city, lowering fares to attract riders and boosting payments to attract drivers. By paying out more than it takes in on those early trips, Uber is able to reach critical scale faster than a more conservative competitor. — location: [790]()

Peter Drucker wrote that business models are essentially theories composed of assumptions about the business, which circumstances might require to change over time. Harvard Business School professor and author Clay Christensen believes that you need to focus on the concept of the â€œjob-to-be-doneâ€; that is, when a customer buys a product, she is â€œhiringâ€ it to do a particular job. Then thereâ€™s Brian Chesky of Airbnb, who said simply, â€œBuild a product people love. Hire amazing people. What else is there to do? Everything else is fake work.â — location: [864]()

Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at NYUâ€™s Stern School of Business, estimated that Uber was probably worth roughly $6Â billion, based on its ability to ultimately win 10Â percent of the global taxi market of $100Â billion, or $10Â billion. According to Uberâ€™s own projections, in 2016 the company processed over $26Â billion in payments. Itâ€™s safe to say that the $10Â billion market was a serious underestimate, as the ease of use and lower cost of Uber and its competitors expanded the market for transportation-as-a-service. — location: [910]()

A) Leveraging Existing Networks New companies rarely have the reach or resources to simply pour money into advertising campaigns. Instead, they have to find creative ways to tap into existing networks to distribute their products. — location: [946]()
{ #ref-36297}


---
B) Virality â€œViralâ€ distribution occurs when the users of a product bring more users, and those users bring additional users, and so on, much like an infectious virus spreads from host to host. Virality can either be organicâ€”occurring during the course of normal usage of the productâ€”or incentivized by some kind of reward. — location: [969]()
{ #ref-52223}


---
Incentives donâ€™t have to be monetary; like PayPal, Dropbox used a similar combination of organic virality (as users share files with nonusers) and incentivized virality (Basic account holders get 500Â MB of extra storage per user they refer; Pro account holders get 1Â GB) to grow. — location: [985]()

What we did is we went on Craigslist and offered $40 to anyone whoâ€™d come in for half an hourâ€”a poor manâ€™s usability test. Weâ€™re like, â€œAll right, sit down. This is an invitation to Dropbox in your e-mail. Go from here to sharing a file with this e-mail address.â€ Zero of the five people we tested succeeded. Zero of the five even came close. This was just stunning. Weâ€™re like, â€œOh my God, this is the worst product ever created.â€ So we made a list of like eighty things in this Excel spreadsheet, then just sanded down all these rough edges in the experience, and watched our activation rate climb. Virality almost always requires a product that is either free or freemium (i.e., free up to a certain point, after which the user has to pay to upgradeâ€”Dropbox, for example, offers 2Â GB of free storage). — location: [994]()

Gross margins, which represent sales minus the cost of goods sold, are probably the best measure of long-term unit economics. The higher the gross margin, the more valuable each dollar of sales is to the company because it means that for each dollar of sales, the company has more cash available to fund growth and expansion. — location: [1008]()
{ #ref-43482}


---
Typically, you focus solely on the cost to you, and the perceived benefits of the purchase. This means that itâ€™s not necessarily any easier to sell a low-margin product than a high-margin product. If possible then, a company should design a high-gross-margin business model. — location: [1026]()
{ #ref-45782}


---
Appealing to investors makes it easier to raise larger amounts of money at higher valuations when the company is privately held (weâ€™ll delve into the details of why this is so important later on), and lowers the cost of capital when the company is publicly traded. This access to capital is a key factor in being able to finance lightning-fast growth. — location: [1031]()

GROWTH FACTOR #4: NETWORK EFFECTS — location: [1050]()
{ #ref-19489}


---
A product or service is subject to positive network effects when increased usage by any user increases the value of the product or service for other users. Economists refer to these effects as â€œdemand-side economies of scaleâ€ or, more generally, â€œpositive externalities.â€ — location: [1068]()
{ #ref-60815}


---
Five Categories of Network Effects — location: [1085]()
{ #ref-41244}


---
Direct Network Effects: Increases in usage lead to direct increases in value. — location: [1088]()
{ #ref-42647}


---
Indirect Network Effects: Increases in usage encourage consumption of complementary goods, which increases the value of the original product. — location: [1089]()
{ #ref-24689}


---
Two-Sided Network Effects: Increases in usage by one set of users increases the value to a different set of complementary users, and vice versa. — location: [1092]()
{ #ref-32288}


---
Local Network Effects: Increases in usage by a small subset of users increases the value for a connected user. — location: [1094]()
{ #ref-50069}


---
Compatibility and Standards: The use of one technology product encourages the use of compatible products. — location: [1097]()
{ #ref-33221}


---
With network effects businesses, you canâ€™t start small and hope to grow slowly; until your product is widely adopted in a particular market, it offers little value to potential users. Economists would say that the business has to get past the â€œtipping pointâ€ where the demand curve intersects with the supply curve. — location: [1108]()
{ #ref-33296}


---
The value users place on the service when deciding whether or not to adopt it depends on both the current level of adoption and their expectations for future adoption. If they think others are going to jump on board, the perceived value of the service increases, and they become more likely to adopt it. — location: [1120]()

Because products and services that are already popular will almost always come up first in search results, companies with a competitive advantage can quickly grow to the point where the increasing returns of network effects produce a winner-take-most or winner-take-all market. This also explains why the growth factor of distribution is as or more important to company success as the product itselfâ€”without distribution, it is difficult to reach the tipping point. — location: [1137]()

Managers are frontline leaders who worry about day-to-day tactics: they create, implement, and execute detailed plans that allow the organization to either do new things or do existing things more efficiently. By contrast, the role of the executive is to lead managers. For the most part, executives donâ€™t manage individual contributors. Instead, they focus on vision and strategy. Yet they are still connected to the frontline employees because they are also responsible for the â€œfighting spiritâ€ of their organizations; they need to be role models who help people persist through inevitable adversity.

One of the misconceptions of entrepreneurship is that you work out a plan and then execute it.

But if bad management saves you from building a warehouse in the wrong part of town and lets you quickly turn that structure into a successful hotel (or saves you from losing money on mobile cash and lets you quickly capture the market for global payments), then it might be the best approach you can take. — location: [3067]()

One of the reasons for evolving your culture is the â€œShip of Theseusâ€ paradox. The ancient historian Plutarch coined the term in reference to the ship on which the mythical hero Theseus returned to Athens after slaying the Minotaur. As the legend goes, the Athenians had preserved the famous vessel by replacing broken parts with new wood, until at last none of the original wood remained. Plutarch reported that philosophers argued strenuously, and without resolution, over whether the ship of replacement parts was still the Ship of Theseus. (Amusingly, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes complicated matters by asking what would happen if the original wood parts were preserved after being replaced, and were then used to build a second ship!) All companies are like the Ship of Theseus. Employees join, stay for one or more tours of duty, and leave, only to be replaced by new employees. A stable, low-growth company might persist for decades or longer, slowly replacing employees but remaining the same size and retaining a strong sense of continuity. In other words, the â€œplanksâ€ of the ship remain essentially unchanged from decade to decade. In contrast, a blitzscaling company like Facebook might grow from the Family to Nation stage in a single decade, doubling or tripling in size each year, so that the employees who made up the entire ship on New Yearâ€™s Day end up as a small minority by the following New Yearâ€™s Eve. — location: [3461]()

a blitzscaling project needs to be insulated from the rest of the company so that the executive in charge can run it effectively. The classic example is Steve Jobsâ€™s approach to managing the original Macintosh team, which had separate offices that were off-limits to regular Apple employees. More recently, Larry Page applied this same technique to Android by allowing Andy Rubinâ€™s team to work in separate officesâ€”Google employee badges didnâ€™t grant access to Android officesâ€”and adopt different hiring practices from those of the parent company. Much the same was true for the PlayStation project at Sony, the Kindle project at Amazon, and the Watson team at IBM. — location: [3751]()

In 2001, eBay acquired a French company called iBazar, which had a Brazilian subsidiary. Because eBay wanted to focus on Europe, it made MercadoLibre an offer: take over the Brazilian operation in exchange for 19.9Â percent of MercadoLibre. The deal included both a five-year noncompete agreement (which meant that MercadoLibre didnâ€™t have to worry about eBay expanding into the Latin American market for at least that time period) and a best practices sharing agreement. — location: [3947]()

PricewaterhouseCoopers projects that Chinaâ€™s economy will overtake that of the United States in size by 2030. In many areas, it already has. In 2016, the volume of mobile payments in China was $8.6Â trillion. In comparison, the same figure for the United States was $112Â billion. In other words, Chinaâ€™s mobile payments market was nearly seventy-seven times that of the United States. Didi Chuxing provides twenty million rides per day in China, over triple the volume of Uber worldwide. — location: [3973]()

Chinese blitzscalers work with an intensity that few in Silicon Valley can match. Rather than staying open during the standard American business hours of 9Â a.m. to 5Â p.m., Xiaomi operates on a â€œ996â€ modelâ€”get in at 9Â a.m., leave the office at 9Â p.m., and work six days a week. — location: [4002]()

Start-ups can and will fail, and all entrepreneurial enterprises create risk for founders, employees, and investors. At the same time, they also create the possibility for new businesses, new innovations, and new jobs. But the most successful modern societies err on the side of freedom rather than trying to outlaw all risks, and on the whole we are all better off because we allow entrepreneurs to take those risks. — location: [4154]()

In other words, your success is contingent upon society functioning properly. Here in Silicon Valley, some might fantasize about floating cities in international waters, but the fact is that blitzscaling businesses rely on the rule of law, robust financial markets, and an education system that produces talented employees and a healthy market of consumers. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, we win the â€œovarian lotteryâ€ when weâ€™re born into blitzscaling ecosystems. — location: [4178]()
