### What is Public Stock?

> Public stock represents ownership in a publicly traded company, where shares are made available for purchase by the general public through stock exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets. When individuals buy stock, they acquire partial ownership in the company, often with rights to vote on corporate matters and receive dividends. Public companies, such as [[010 Brain/010 My Brain/202207152017 - Apple Inc.\|202207152017 - Apple Inc.]] or [[McDonald's\|McDonald's]], are required to disclose financial information regularly to ensure transparency and accountability[[1\|1]][[2\|2]].

### How Public Stock is Traded: Historically and Today

**Historically**:
- The concept of stock trading began in the early 1600s with the establishment of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange\|Amsterdam Stock Exchange]], where shares of the [[Dutch East India Company\|Dutch East India Company]] were tradedâ€”the first publicly traded company[[3\|3]].
- In the U.S., stock trading gained prominence with the creation of the [[New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\|New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)]] in 1792, following the [[Buttonwood Agreement\|Buttonwood Agreement]]. Early trading was conducted manually through open outcry systems on exchange floors[[3\|3]][[4\|4]].

**Today**:
- Modern stock markets operate electronically, with sophisticated systems matching buy and sell orders almost instantaneously. Major exchanges like the NYSE and [[NASDAQ\|NASDAQ]] facilitate global trading.
- Stocks are traded in two primary markets:
  - **Primary Market**: Companies issue new shares through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) to raise capital[[4\|4]].
  - **Secondary Market**: Investors trade existing shares among themselves, with prices determined by supply and demand[[4\|4]].

### Ways to Purchase Stock

1. **Direct Stock Plans (DSPs)**:
   - Some companies allow investors to buy shares directly from them without a broker. This often requires meeting certain conditions, such as being an employee or existing shareholder[[5\|5]][[6\|6]].

2. **Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs)**:
   - Investors can reinvest dividends from stocks they already own to purchase additional shares automatically[[5\|5]][[6\|6]].

3. **Brokerage Accounts**:
   - Most stocks are purchased through online or full-service brokers. Online brokers like [[Charles Schwab\|Charles Schwab]] or [[Robinhood\|Robinhood]] offer low-cost platforms for buying and selling stocks[[8\|8]][[9\|9]].

4. **Stock Funds**:
   - [[Investors\|Investors]] can buy mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold a diversified portfolio of stocks, offering a less hands-on approach[[5\|5]][[6\|6]].

5. **Fractional Shares**:
   - Many brokers now allow investors to purchase fractional shares, enabling them to invest in expensive stocks like [[20220708 - Google\|20220708 - Google]] with smaller amounts of money[[8\|8]][[9\|9]].

6. **Robo-Advisors**:
   - Automated platforms invest on behalf of users based on their risk tolerance and financial goals, making it easy for beginners to enter the market[[9\|9]].

By leveraging these methods, individuals can participate in stock ownership and potentially benefit from capital appreciation and dividends while contributing to the growth of publicly traded companies.
