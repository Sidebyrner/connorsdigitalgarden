#### 1. **Promote Work-Life Balance**

- **[[Remote Work\|Remote Work]] Dynamics:** While remote working is preferred, it can lead to longer hours. 39% of remote workers report working more hours compared to 31% of office-based workers.
- **Case Study - The Slumber Yard:** Implemented a no-work-emails policy between 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. to prevent burnout.
    - **Outcome:** Employees became more energized and productive, reducing costly turnover.

#### 2. **Invest in Trust Building**

- **Transparency in Decision Making:** 80% of workers want more transparency on decisions, and 87% value it in their future workplaces.
- **Example - Culture Amp:**
    - Values include trusting employees to make decisions and promoting vulnerability and feedback.
    - Initiatives like a Slack channel (#yay-we-failed) for discussing mistakes and a #ceo channel for direct communication with the CEO foster trust and transparency.
    - **Pandemic Response:** Daily videos from the CEO provided updates and reassurance, enhancing connection and transparency.

#### 3. **Go Beyond “My Door is Always Open”**

- **Active Engagement:** Regular interaction with employees is crucial.
- **Stay Interviews:** Conducted by HR consultants like Marissa Letendre, these interviews focus on understanding what keeps employees motivated and what they would like to change.
    - **Example - 70-person Company:** Creation of a culture committee based on feedback led to a 32% increase in engagement and a 28% increase in performance.

#### 4. **Support Employee-Led Initiatives**

- **Example - PwC's Be Well, Work Well Program:**
    - Initiated due to employee interest in wellness, covering dimensions like physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, financial, and social well-being.
    - Evolved with remote work to include virtual support and reimbursement for crisis childcare.
    - Demonstrates listening to and investing in employees’ well-being.

#### 5. **Don’t Ignore the Power of Small Gestures**

- **Recognition and Appreciation:** Small gestures can significantly boost morale.
- **Example - Canva:**
    - Hybrid work model with employees required to be in the office only eight times a year.
    - Uses Disco, a platform integrated with Slack, for recognition.
    - Offers mindfulness and meditation app subscriptions, and personalized appreciation cards.

### Ongoing Efforts for Boosting Team Morale

- **Regular Assessment:** Use employee satisfaction surveys or tools like Trivago's custom bot to measure sentiment.
- **Balanced Approach:** Cultivate morale with significant policies and career growth opportunities, alongside social events, regular recognition, and small tokens of appreciation.

### Conclusion

Promoting work-life balance and enhancing employee morale involves strategic initiatives that range from policy changes to small, meaningful gestures. Regular engagement, transparent communication, and support for employee-led initiatives are crucial for fostering a positive and productive work environment.
