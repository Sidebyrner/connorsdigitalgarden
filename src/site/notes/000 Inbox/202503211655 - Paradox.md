A paradox is a statement or situation that seems to be self-contradictory or absurd but may, in fact, be true or contain a deeper truth. Paradoxes often involve contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that persist over time, leading to a "unity of opposites" where both parts of the paradox can be considered accurate despite their apparent contradiction[1][4].

### Types of Paradoxes
1. **Logical Paradoxes**: These are statements that lead to a logical contradiction, often used to highlight flaws in reasoning or definitions. Examples include the [[Liar Paradox\|Liar Paradox]] ("This sentence is false") and [[Russell's Paradox\|Russell's Paradox]], which questions whether a set of all sets that do not contain themselves contains itself[1][3].

2. **Literary Paradoxes**: Used in literature to create striking exposition or unexpected insights. They juxtapose incongruous ideas to reveal deeper meanings or truths. Examples include Oscar Wilde's "I can resist anything except temptation" and Shakespeare's "I must be cruel only to be kind"[2][7].

### Examples and Usage
- **Philosophical Paradoxes**: The [[Ship of Theseus\|Ship of Theseus]] paradox questions whether a ship remains the same if all its parts are replaced over time[1].
- **Literary Examples**: In *[[Animal Farm\|Animal Farm]]*, [[& George Orwell\|& George Orwell]] writes, "All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others," highlighting a paradoxical social hierarchy[4].
- **Catch-22**: A famous literary paradox from Joseph Heller's novel, where a pilot can be excused from duty if deemed insane, but requesting such an excuse is considered sane behavior[7].

Paradoxes are valuable tools in both logic and literature, encouraging critical thinking and providing insightful commentary on complex issues.
