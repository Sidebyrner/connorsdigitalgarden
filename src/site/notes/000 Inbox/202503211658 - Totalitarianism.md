[[The differences between Totalitarianism and Socialism\|The differences between Totalitarianism and Socialism]]

Under such regimes, opposition is suppressed, civil liberties are restricted, and the state exercises complete control over the economy, education, media, and even personal morality[[1\|1]][[6\|6]]. Totalitarian governments often employ propaganda, censorship, mass surveillance, and state-sponsored terror to maintain their grip on power[[7\|7]][[9\|9]].

### Characteristics and Examples

Key features of totalitarianism include:
- **Suppression of Dissent**: Political opposition is outlawed, and dissent is met with severe consequences[[2\|2]][[6\|6]].
- **Propaganda and Ideology**: State-controlled media disseminates a singular ideology to manipulate public perception[[1\|1]][[9\|9]].
- **State Surveillance**: Citizens are constantly monitored to ensure loyalty[[7\|7]][[6\|6]].
- **Personality Cult**: Leaders are glorified as infallible figures[[2\|2]][[7\|7]].

Historical examples include Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, and North Korea under the Kim dynasty. These regimes have committed some of history's most egregious atrocities, such as the Holocaust and the Cambodian Genocide[[3\|3]][[4\|4]]. While totalitarian states often collapse due to internal resistance or external pressures, their legacy leaves lasting scars on societies[[8\|8]].
