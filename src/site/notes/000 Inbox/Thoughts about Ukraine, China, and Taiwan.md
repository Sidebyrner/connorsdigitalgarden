## Thesis
The united states [since 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Relations_Act) has had military strategy in place to defend Taiwan vs. China. During the most recent military operations in Ukraine, it is apparent that these agreements are beginning to dig into the fabric of domestic policy and promote the privatized military complex amid an ongoing shortage of chips and supplies to the american public. 

With strained supply of weapons to our allies, when does it come time for another country, like China, to mount an assault on our homeland that cannot be met by equal and opposite force?
