### What is a Ransomware Attack?

A **ransomware attack** is a type of cyberattack where malicious software (malware) encrypts a victim's files or systems, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid, typically in cryptocurrency. The attacker provides a decryption key only after payment, although there is no guarantee the files will be restored. Modern ransomware often employs double extortion, where attackers threaten to leak sensitive data if the ransom is not paid[[1\|1]][[2\|2]][[10\|10]].

### How Ransomware Attacks Work

Ransomware attacks generally follow these stages:
1. **Infection**: Attackers gain access to systems using phishing emails, malicious links, or exploiting software vulnerabilities.
2. **[[Encryption\|Encryption]]**: The malware encrypts critical files and may spread across networks.
3. **Ransom Demand**: Victims receive a ransom note with payment instructions, often demanding cryptocurrency[[1\|1]][[6\|6]][[10\|10]].

### Examples and Impact

High-profile ransomware attacks include:
- **WannaCry (2017)**: Exploited the [[EternalBlue\|EternalBlue]] vulnerability in outdated [[Windows Operating System\|Windows Operating System]], affecting over 200,000 computers globally[[3\|3]].
- **CryptoLocker (2013)**: Spread via email attachments and encrypted files using [[RSA cryptography\|RSA cryptography]][[3\|3]].
- **Clop MOVEit Attack (2023)**: Targeted file transfer software vulnerabilities, exposing sensitive data from over 255 organizations[[7\|7]].

> Ransomware has become one of the most significant cybersecurity threats, with global damages projected to reach $265 billion annually by 2031[[7\|7]]. It has disrupted hospitals, governments, and businesses worldwide[[9\|9]].

### Prevention and Mitigation

Organizations can reduce ransomware risks by:
- Maintaining offline backups of critical data.
- Regularly updating software to patch vulnerabilities.
- Using antivirus tools and firewalls.
- Conducting employee training on phishing awareness[[4\|4]][[8\|8]][[10\|10]].

While paying the ransom may seem like the quickest solution, experts advise against it due to ethical concerns and the lack of guarantees for data recovery[[6\|6]]. Robust security measures and incident response plans are essential to mitigate ransomware threats effectively.
