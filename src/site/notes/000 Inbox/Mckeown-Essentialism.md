## Highlights
Weniger aber besser. The English translation is: Less but better. A more fitting definition of Essentialism would be hard to come by. The way of the Essentialist is the relentless pursuit of less but better. It doesn’t mean occasionally giving a nod to the principle. It means pursuing it in a disciplined way. — location: [159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=159)

Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless. — location: [179](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=179)

In trying to keep everyone happy I had sacrificed what mattered most. On reflection I discovered this important lesson: If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. — location: [237](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=237)

“the paradox of success,”2 which can be summed up in four predictable phases: PHASE 1: When we really have clarity of purpose, it enables us to succeed at our endeavor. PHASE 2: When we have success, we gain a reputation as a “go to” person. We become “good old [insert name],” who is always there when you need him, and we are presented with increased options and opportunities. PHASE 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, which is actually code for demands upon our time and energies, it leads to diffused efforts. We get spread thinner and thinner. PHASE 4: We become distracted from what would otherwise be our highest level of contribution. The effect of our success has been to undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=263)

the preponderance of choice has overwhelmed our ability to manage it. We have lost our ability to filter what is important and what isn’t. Psychologists call this “decision fatigue”: the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decisions deteriorates. — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=288)

Only in the 1900s did we pluralize the term and start talking about priorities. Illogically, we reasoned that by changing the word we could bend reality. — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=308)

When we don’t purposefully and deliberately choose where to focus our energies and time, other people—our bosses, our colleagues, our clients, and even our families—will choose for us, and before long we’ll have lost sight of everything that is meaningful and important. We can either make our choices deliberately or allow other people’s agendas to control our lives. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=312)

sunk-cost bias: studies have found that we tend to value things we already own more highly than they are worth and thus that we find them more difficult to get rid of. If you’re not quite there, ask the killer question: “If I didn’t already own this, how much would I spend to buy it?” This usually does the trick. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=340)

If we search for “a good opportunity,” then we will find scores of pages for us to think about and work through. Instead, we can conduct an advanced search and ask three questions: “What do I feel deeply inspired by?” and “What am I particularly talented at?” and “What meets a significant need in the world?” — location: [391](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00G1J1D28&location=391)
