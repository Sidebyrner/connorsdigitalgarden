## Highlights
Trump’s rise had been abetted by strange new grassroots movements and hyperpartisan outlets that thrived online, as well as Russian agents who’d exploited social media’s reality-distorting, identity-indulging tendencies. This global pattern seemed to indicate something fundamental to the technology, but exactly what that was, why it was happening, or what it meant, nobody was able to tell me. — location: [73](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=73)

A strange pattern emerged in my conversations at Facebook’s headquarters. An executive would walk me through the challenge that consumed their days: blocking terrorists from recruiting on the platform, outmaneuvering hostile government hackers, determining which combinations of words constituted an unacceptable incitement to violence. Nearly any question I posed, however sensitive, yielded a direct, nuanced answer. When problems remained unsolved, they acknowledged as much. No one ever had to check their notes to tell me, say, Facebook’s policy on Kurdish independence groups or its methods for distributing hate-speech rules in Tagalog. I found myself wondering: with such conscientious, ultra-qualified people in charge, why do the problems for which they articulate such thoughtful answers only ever seem to get worse? — location: [112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=112)

as QAnon became a movement with tens of thousands of followers, an internal FBI report identified it as a domestic terror threat.

“Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness,” the researchers warned in a 2018 presentation later leaked to the Wall Street Journal.

In summer 2020, an independent audit of Facebook, commissioned by the company under pressure from civil rights groups, concluded that the platform was everything its executives had insisted to me it was not. Its policies permitted rampant misinformation that could undermine elections. Its algorithms and recommendation systems were “driving people toward self-reinforcing echo chambers of extremism,” training them to hate. Perhaps most damning, the report concluded that the company did not understand how its own products affected its billions of users. — location: [163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=163)

Silicon Valley’s mostly self-invented lore, instilled the Valley with cultural and economic traits that were built into the products that increasingly rule our world. And it began with a wave of pioneers who played a role as crucial as any of the engineers or CEOs who came after them: the military-industrial complex. — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=262)

Frederick Terman, the son of a psychology professor at then-unremarkable Stanford University, spent World War II at Harvard’s labs, overseeing joint military–academic research projects. He returned home with an idea: that this model continue into peacetime, with university scientists cooperating instead with private companies. He established the Stanford Research Park, where companies could work alongside academic researchers. — location: [271](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=271)

Stanford blurred the line between academic and for-profit work, a development that became core to the Silicon Valley worldview, absorbed and propagated by countless companies cycling through the Research Park. Hitting it big in the tech business and advancing human welfare, the thinking went, were not only compatible, they were one and the same. These conditions made 1950s Santa Clara what Margaret O’Mara, a prominent historian of Silicon Valley, has called a silicon Galápagos. Much as those islands’ peculiar geology and extreme isolation produced one-of-a-kind bird and lizard species, the Valley’s peculiar conditions produced ways of doing business and of seeing the world that could not have flourished anywhere else—and led ultimately to Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. — location: [276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=276)

The chance migration that seeded much of the Valley’s technological DNA, like an adrift iguana landing on a Galápagos shore, was a cantankerous engineer named William Shockley. At Bell Labs, perhaps the most prestigious of the East Coast research firms, he’d shared a 1956 Nobel Prize for pioneering new semi-conductive transistors. The tiny devices, which direct or modify electrical signals, are the building blocks of modern electronics. Shockley became convinced he could beat Bell’s methods. — location: [282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=282)

That year, halfway through the second Obama term, a significant threshold was crossed in the human experience. For the first time, the 200 million Americans with an active Facebook account spent, on average, more time on the platform (forty minutes per day) than they did socializing in person (thirty-eight minutes). Just two years later, by the summer of 2016, nearly 70 percent of Americans used Facebook-owned platforms, averaging fifty minutes per day. — location: [356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=356)

“The thought process that went into building these applications,” Parker told the media conference, “was all about, ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’” To do that, he said, “We need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that’s going to get you to contribute more content, and that’s going to get you more likes and comments.” He termed this the “social-validation feedback loop,” calling it “exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” He and Zuckerberg “understood this” from the beginning, he said, and “we did it anyway.” — location: [375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=375)

“How do companies, producing little more than bits of code displayed on a screen, seemingly control users’ minds?” Nir Eyal, a prominent Valley product consultant, asked in his 2014 book, Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. “Our actions have been engineered,” he explained.

intermittent variable reinforcement. The concept, while sounding esoteric, is devilishly simple. The psychologist B. F. Skinner found that if he assigned a human subject a repeatable task—solving a simple puzzle, say—and rewarded her every time she completed it, she would usually comply, but would stop right after he stopped rewarding her. But if he doled out the reward only sometimes, and randomized its size, then she would complete the task far more consistently, even doggedly. And she would keep completing the task long after the rewards had stopped altogether—as if chasing even the possibility of a reward compulsively. — location: [405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=405)

Abusers veer unpredictably between kindness and cruelty, punishing partners for behaviors that they had previously rewarded with affection. This can lead to something called traumatic bonding.

In 2018, a team of economists offered users different amounts of money to deactivate their account for four weeks, looking for the threshold at which at least half of them would say yes.

That little button’s appeal, and much of social media’s power, comes from exploiting something called the sociometer. The concept emerged out of a question posed by the psychologist Mark Leary: what is the purpose of self-esteem? The anguish we feel from low self-esteem is wholly self-generated. We would not have developed such an unusual and painful vulnerability, Leary reasoned, unless it provided some benefit outweighing its tremendous psychic costs. His theory, now widely held, is that self-esteem is in fact “a psychological gauge of the degree to which people perceive that they are relationally valued and socially accepted by other people.” — location: [439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=439)

Brian Hare called “survival of the friendliest.” The result was the development of a sociometer: a tendency to unconsciously monitor how other people in our community seem to perceive us. We process that information in the form of self-esteem and such related emotions as pride, shame, or insecurity. These emotions compel us to do more of what makes our community value us and less of what doesn’t. And, crucially, they are meant to make that motivation feel like it is coming from within. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=448)

“When Facebook changed their algorithm, my likes dropped off and it felt like I wasn’t getting enough oxygen,” Pearlman later told Vice News. “So even if I could blame it on the algorithm, something inside me was like, ‘They don’t like me, I’m not good enough.’” Her own former employer had turned her brain’s nucleus accumbens against her, creating an internal drive for likes so powerful that it overrode her better judgment. Then, like Skinner toying with a research subject, it simply turned the rewards off. “Suddenly I was buying ads, just to get that attention back,” she admitted. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=474)

## Expanding Influence of Gaming 
She posted frequently, and sometimes stridently, in support of a cause then gaining momentum among like-minded game-makers and journalists: broadening gaming’s appeal and fan culture beyond its traditional enclave of young male geeks. But some online gaming circles seethed at feminist transgressors who sought, they believed, to corrupt the hobby that had become, amid a world that struck many early social media obsessives as hostile and confusing, a kind of safe space. This was more than a debate over whether prince-rescues-buxom-princess games could make room for offbeat entries like Quinn’s, or even for girl gamers; it was about a geek male identity whose adherents saw themselves as under attack.

It sent the extremes of the social web smashing against mainstream American life, forever ending the separation between digital and nondigital spaces, between internet culture and culture. It also launched a new kind of politics, defined by social media’s foundational traits: a digital culture built around nihilistic young men, Silicon Valley dreams of destructive revolution, and platforms designed in ways that supercharge identity into a matter of totalizing and existential conflict. — location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=629)

“When you browse 4chan and 8chan while the rest of your friends are posting normie live-laugh-love shit on Instagram and Facebook,” Adam said, “you feel different. Cooler. Part of something niche.” The joke might be a photo of scatological pornography. A video of a grisly murder. A racial slur posted to get a rise out of people, daring them to take it seriously. Laughing off the material—or, better yet, one-upping it—affirmed that you shared the club’s knowing, cynical detachment. And it recast their relationship with the outside world: it’s not society rejecting us, it’s us rejecting society. These two unifying activities, flaunting taboos and pulling pranks, converged to become trolling.

“There’s this conspiracy-correlation effect,” DiResta said, “in which the platform recognizes that somebody who’s interested in conspiracy A is typically likely to be interested in conspiracy B, and pops it up to them.” Facebook’s groups era promoted something more specific than passive consumption of conspiracies.

The student, once praised online as a hero, was now condemned as a villain. Few thought to blame the social media platforms that had empowered a teenager to destroy the livelihoods of low-income workers, incentivized her and thousands of onlookers to do it, and ensured that all would experience her outrage-provoking misimpression as truer than the truth. Truth or falsity has little bearing on a post’s reception, except to the extent that a liar is freer to alter facts to conform to a button-pushing narrative. What matters is whether the post can provoke a powerful reaction, usually outrage. A 2013 study of the Chinese platform Weibo found that anger consistently travels further than other sentiments.

Every time an ancient human clan tore down a despotic alpha, they were doing the same thing that Lyudmila Trut did to her foxes: selecting for docility. More cooperative males reproduced, the aggressive ones did not. We self-domesticated. But just as early humans were breeding one form of aggression out, they were selecting another in: the collective violence they’d used both to topple the alphas and to impose a new order in their place. Life became ruled by what the anthropologist Ernest Gellner called “tyranny of the cousins.” Tribes became leaderless, consensus-based societies, held together by fealty to a shared moral code, which the group’s adults (the “cousins”) enforced, at times violently. “To be a nonconformist, to offend community standards, or to gain a reputation for being mean became dangerous adventures,” Wrangham wrote. Upset the collective and you might be shunned or exiled—or wake up to a rock slamming into your forehead.

the number of seconds in your day never changes. The amount of social media content competing for those seconds, however, doubles every year or so, depending on how you measure it. Imagine, for instance, that your network produces 200 posts per day, of which you have time to read 100. Because of the platforms’ tilt, you will see the most moral-emotional half of your feed. Next year, when 200 doubles to 400, you see the most moral-emotional quarter. The year after that, the most moral-emotional eighth. Over time, your impression of your own community becomes radically more moralizing, aggrandizing, and outraged—and so do you.

The scholar J. M. Berger calls it “the crisis-solution construct.” When people feel destabilized, they often reach for a strong group identity to regain a sense of control. It can be as broad as nationality or narrow as a church group. Identities that promise to recontextualize individual hardships into a wider conflict hold special appeal. You’re not unhappy because of your struggle to contend with personal circumstances; you’re unhappy because of Them and their persecution of Us. It makes those hardships feel comprehensible and, because you’re no longer facing them alone, a lot less scary. Crisis-solution: there is a crisis, the out-group is responsible, your in-group offers the solution. If that sense of conflict escalates too far, it can reach the point of radicalization, in which you see the out-group as an immutable threat over which only total victory is acceptable. “The scale of the crisis becomes more extreme, and the prescribed solution becomes more violent,” Berger wrote, until destroying the out-group becomes the core of the in-group’s shared identity. — location: [3255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=3255)

That spring, after a school shooting, YouTube’s high-profile “trending” page began promoting an Alex Jones video claiming that the violence had been faked. Jones had pushed versions of this since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, when he called the murdered twenty children and six teachers “crisis actors” in a vague government plot to justify confiscating guns or imposing martial law. The conspiracy had spread on YouTube ever since, consumed by growing numbers of viewers who, enraged, organized years-long harassment campaigns against the families of the murdered children. Some parents went into hiding, and several filed three separate lawsuits against Jones for defamation. (In 2021, Jones lost all three.) All the while, YouTube continued promoting the videos, which by 2018 had a combined 50 million views. When YouTube’s system posted Jones’s latest on its trending page, then, it was an unusually visible indicator of how eagerly the site’s algorithms boosted him. Members of YouTube’s policy team recommended tweaking the trending-page algorithm to prevent it from linking to Jones or other discredited sources. They were overruled. Although Jones was most prominent on YouTube, where he had billions of views, he reached millions of followers on Facebook and Twitter as well, and these companies also came under pressure to revoke the digital bullhorns they’d made for him. — location: [3351](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=3351)

People who deleted Facebook became happier, more satisfied with their life, and less anxious. The emotional change was equivalent to 25 to 40 percent of the effect of going to therapy—a stunning drop for a four-week break. Four in five said afterward that deactivating had been good for them. Facebook quitters also spent 15 percent less time consuming the news. They became, as a result, less knowledgeable about current events—the only negative effect. But much of the knowledge they had lost seemed to be from polarizing content; information packaged in a way to indulge tribal antagonisms. Overall, the economists wrote, deactivation “significantly reduced polarization of views on policy issues and a measure of exposure to polarizing news.” Their level of polarization dropped by almost half the amount by which the average American’s polarization had risen between 1996 and 2018—the very period during which the democracy-endangering polarization crisis had occurred. — location: [3811](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=3811)

Erica Chenoweth, a scholar of civil resistance at Harvard. The frequency of mass-protest movements had been growing worldwide since the 1950s, she found, and had accelerated lately. Between the 2000s and the 2010s, average episodes per year had jumped nearly 50 percent. Their success rate had been growing, too, year after year, for decades. Around 2000, 70 percent of protest movements demanding systemic change succeeded. But then, suddenly, that trend reversed. They began failing—just as they were getting more frequent. Now, Chenoweth found, only 30 percent of mass movements succeeded. “Something has really shifted,” she told me, calling the drop “staggering.” Virtually every month, another country would erupt in nationwide protests: Lebanon over corruption, India over gender inequality, Spain over Catalan separatism. Many at a scale exceeding the most transformative movements of the twentieth century. And most of them fizzling. To explain this, Chenoweth drew on an observation by Zeynep Tufekci, the University of North Carolina scholar: social media makes it easier for activists to organize protests and to quickly draw once-unthinkable numbers—but this may actually be a liability. For one, social media, though initially greeted as a force for liberation, “really advantages repression in the digital age much more than mobilization,” Chenoweth said. Dictators had learned how to turn it to their advantage, using their superior resources to flood platforms with disinformation and propaganda. The effect in democracies was subtler but still powerful. Chenoweth cited, as a comparison, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a civil rights–era student group. Before social media, activists had to mobilize through community outreach and organization-building. They met almost daily to drill, strategize, and confer. It was agonizing, years-long work. But it made the movement durable, built on real-world ties and chains of command. It allowed movements like SNCC to persevere when things got hard, respond strategically to events, and translate street victories into political change. Social media allows protests to skip many of those steps, putting more bodies on the streets more quickly. “That can give people a sense of false confidence,” Chenoweth said, “because it’s lower commitment.” Without the underlying infrastructure, social media movements are less able to organize coherent demands, coordinate, or act strategically. And by channeling popular energy away from the harder kind of organizing, it preempts traditional movements from emerging. — location: [3863](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09FJPPQQ3&location=3863)
