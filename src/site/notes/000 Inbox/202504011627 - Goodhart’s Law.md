## Defined
> "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
### Simplified Core Topics and Talking Points:

1. **Goodhart's Law**: [[Shopify\|Shopify]] CEO [[Tobi Lütke\|Tobi Lütke]] highlights the principle that "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." He explains that metrics lose their usefulness when they are optimized as goals, as this distorts the broader objectives of a complex business.

2. **Avoiding KPIs and OKRs**: Shopify intentionally avoids rigid frameworks like [[KPIs\|KPIs]] and [[OKRs\|OKRs]] because no single metric can fully capture the complexities and tensions within a company. Instead, they adopt a balanced approach to decision-making.

3. **Data-Informed, Not Data-Driven**: Shopify values data and has invested heavily in analytics systems but avoids over-reliance on quantifiable metrics. They focus on unquantifiable elements like taste, quality, passion, and craftsmanship, which Tobi believes account for 80% of a product's true value.

4. **Human Judgment Over Metrics**: Shopify compares its approach to a [[Pilot\|Pilot]] using a cockpit—metrics serve as support tools, but decisions are ultimately made by humans. This allows the company to address both quantifiable and qualitative aspects effectively.

5. **Criticism of Quantifiable Optimization**: Tobi critiques the tendency to prioritize highly quantifiable metrics for immediate gratification, arguing that this leaves much of a product's value unaddressed. He advocates for embracing intangible qualities that drive deep satisfaction and long-term success.
