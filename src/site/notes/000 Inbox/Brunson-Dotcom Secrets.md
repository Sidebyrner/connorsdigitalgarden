## Highlights
“Ultimately, the business that can spend the most to acquire a customer wins. A business beats its competition by making the same prospect worth more to his business than to that of his competition.” — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=412)

People often ask me, “Russell, does my business need a funnel?” to which I always respond, “Only if your company needs leads or sales.” If you want to generate leads, there are funnels for that. If you want to sell products, there are funnels for that. Funnels will grow any company. Your goal is to figure out which funnels are right for your specific situation. Most people start with one funnel to acquire new customers and then build other funnels to help them make more money on autopilot from each new lead they get. — location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=427)

If I had a salesperson who just handed out brochures and only waited for people to come and buy, I’d fire them immediately, yet this is what most people are doing with a website. — location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=442)

A funnel, on the other hand, is created to be simple. From the outside, it may look like a website, but you’ll notice that each page and each step only has one call to action. There is strategy behind what page someone sees first, and then the journey you take them on. It’s similar to hiring the best salesperson, putting them outside of your store, and then as each person walks buy, they ask them for their name and contact information. After they have that, then they ask the person what it is they are looking for. When they find out, they take the person into the store, bypassing the dozen things that could distract them, and helping them find the exact thing they are looking for. After the salesperson gives them exactly what they are looking for, they can upsell them on other products or services that perfectly complement the original purchase and will help serve that customer at a higher level. When a salesperson takes someone through a funnel like this, two things happen: The customer has a better user experience. They aren’t confused, and they can find exactly what they’re looking for. You as the store owner actually make more money. Because you don’t confuse your customers, you upsell them on the right things that will help them on their journey. — location: [448](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=448)

Question #1: Who is your dream customer? If you could pick your dream customer, the type of person who would make you wake up every morning on fire because you’re so excited to work with them, what would they look like? The better you can identify this person, the easier it will be for you to find them. Question #2: Where are they congregating? After we know who we are looking for, the next step is to find out where they are hiding. Where are they spending their time online? When I can identify exactly where they are online, getting them into my funnels becomes easy. Question #3: What is the bait that you can use to attract them to you? Now that I know where they are, my job is to throw out hooks to try to grab their attention. After I have their attention, I tell them a story to build a relationship and increase the perceived value of what I have to offer, and then I need to make them an actual offer to get them into my world. Question #4: What is the unique result that you can create for them? After they have come into my world, what other things can I do to help give them the results they are looking for? People don’t come to you because they want your product, they come to you because they want a specific result. So what is the process you will take them through to give them more value so you can serve them at a higher level and give them a result that will truly change their life? — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=473)

If I were to pick my dream customers, who were they, what did they look like, and what were the offers I could create that would attract them? This is also the first question you need to ask yourself when starting your new company or making the shift to truly grow your existing company. — location: [515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=515)

I read aloud the characteristics for both Mike and Julie. When I asked them to raise their hands if they thought I was talking about them, almost every hand in the group went up. I told them that six years earlier I had written out my dream customer avatar and had focused on creating offers and producing content that would attract that exact person. Six years later I was sitting in a room with 100 of the exact people that I had set out to attract just a few short years earlier. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=548)

---
whenever I come up to any question I have about the direction of my podcast, I go to my avatar and say, “WWJD: What would Jimmy do?” And I know from that one answer that that’s the way I gotta go. So if you sit down and really say, “Hey, this really is the one perfect listener of my podcast,” then you’re going to know that person inside and out. You’re going to know where that person hangs out, what Facebook groups they’re in, what LinkedIn groups they’re in, how to advertise to them, and what lead or ad is going to be appealing to them on Facebook that’s going to get them to download it. — location: [571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=571)
{ #ref-56778}


---
now start thinking about congregations as they relate back to your dream customer. What are the congregations that they are already participating in? Start asking yourself these questions: What are the top websites that my dream customers already go to? What forums or message boards do they participate in? What are the Facebook groups they participate in? Who are the influencers they follow on Facebook and Instagram? What podcasts do they listen to? What are the email newsletters they are subscribed to? What blogs do they read? What channels are they following on YouTube? What keywords are they searching for in Google to find information? — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=631)
{ #ref-37971}


---
Question #3: What is the bait (hook, story, and offer) you’ll use to attract your dream customers? Once we know where the dream customers are, we have to create the right hook to grab their attention. The hooks are the ads that will grab the attention of your dream customers just long enough for you to tell them a story. The goal of the story is to build rapport with them as well as break the false beliefs they have that would keep them from taking you up on your offer. The offer is the thing you’ve created for your dream customer so you can give them the results they desire. If you do this step correctly, it will repel the customers you don’t want to serve and attract the right customers to you. — location: [640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=640)

“You have to understand there are two ways to have the lowest price product in your market. The first is to decrease the price of what you sell (and cut out your margins and profit). The second is to increase the value so much that when you sell it for what it’s worth, it seems inexpensive.” — location: [719](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=719)

---
The goal of an offer in its most simple form is to: Increase the perceived value of what is being sold. Make the thing being sold unique to you and only available within this special offer. — location: [763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=763)

Figure 2.2: To overcome price resistance, increase the value of your offer so it’s worth 10 times more than what you’re selling it for. — location: [768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=768)
{ #ref-15063}


---
My goal for any offer is to make the total value of it 10 times as much as what I am actually charging. So if I’m selling something for $100, I want to add enough value that the entire offer is worth over $1,000, and then I can easily sell it for $100. If I want to sell something for $1,000, then I need to create enough value that it is actually worth $10,000, and then $1,000 will seem like a bargain. — location: [770](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=770)
{ #ref-3786}


---
What are the things you could create to include inside of your offer? The first step to creating your offer is to look at the product or service that you are currently selling and to try to figure out what the other things are that you could include in an offer that would help your dream customers get better results from what they are buying from you. — location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=778)

---
Get good at making offers. The first key to having success with funnels is learning how to make offers. Each ad you post will be making an offer such as: “Click here to see a video that will show you how to ___________.” Each step in your funnels will also have an offer such as: “Give me your email address and I’ll send you a free ___________.” Each level of your value ladder will have a new offer, and every email you send your list will contain some type of offer. Creating offers will not be a one-time exercise, but something that you do over and over again. It’s one, if not the most important, role you have as a business owner. — location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=826)

#1: Brainstorm as many different ideas that you can come up with for other things that you could give your dream customer to help guarantee their success. Step #2: From those ideas, what elements could you take to create an irresistible offer? — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=840)

Whenever I start a new company or start working with someone on their business, the first thing I always do is map out the customer’s value ladder. It helps to give you a vision of how you plan on serving your dream customers and where you want to take them. It helps you figure out the real purpose for your company: the main goal or result that you are trying to help them achieve. Two of my Inner Circle members, Stacey and Paul Martino, call their value ladder their customers’ yellow brick road. They say that when anyone comes into your world, they have an “Oz,” or a result that they want to achieve when they are going to start working with you. — location: [944](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=944)

---
We provide insane amounts of value at each step of our value ladder, so our clients naturally want to ascend, get more value, and pay us more money. It’s how we’re wired as humans: to seek more value from the places that we’ve already received it from. — location: [997](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=997)
{ #ref-22628}

If someone doesn’t have an actual value ladder, they don’t really have a business; they are just selling a product. — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1005)
{ #ref-16721}


---
the goal after you sketch out your value ladder isn’t to build all the tiers, but to focus on one. After you have figured out how to sell that offer, and you have built up pressure from your customers for more, then open the back end of your value ladder and start serving your true fans at a higher level. — location: [1155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1155)

How interesting! I shared something about my family, and suddenly there’s a new segment of the audience attracted to that part of my Attractive Character. This new audience segment suddenly felt they could relate to me, so they had enough trust to purchase from me. — location: [1238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1238)
{ #ref-23098}


---
you will get tired of hearing your backstory way before your market gets tired of it, so you need to start sharing it a lot. So my question for you is, “What are the backstories that you can share that will build a better relationship between you, the Attractive Character, and your dream customers?” — location: [1277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1277)

When Attractive Characters try to win the votes of everyone, they end up reaching no one. Instead, Attractive Characters are typically very polarizing. They share their opinions on hard matters, and they stick to their guns—no matter how many people disagree with them. They draw a line in the sand, and when they take a stand for what they believe in, they split the audience into three camps: those who agree with them, those who are neutral, and those who will disagree with them. — location: [1323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1323)

The Leader: The identity of the leader is usually assumed by people whose goal is to lead their audiences from one place to another. Most leaders have a similar backstory to that of their audiences and therefore know the hurdles and pitfalls their audience members will likely face on the journey to get ultimate results. — location: [1344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1344)
{ #ref-28826}


---
The Adventurer: The adventurer is usually someone who is very curious, but they don’t always have all the answers, so they set out on a journey to discover the ultimate truth. They bring back treasures from their journey and share them with their audience. This identity is very similar to the leader, but instead of leading their audience on a journey to find the result, they are more likely to bring back the answers to give them. — location: [1349](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1349)

Loss and redemption: Loss and redemption stories are very powerful because they show the upside of going through hardship or meeting challenges. You start by telling about some level of success that you had accomplished, but then because of some trial, you lost it all. This storyline will relate to any of your fans or followers who are currently in a time of loss in their lives. As you tell your redemption journey, they will receive faith and hope that by following you they can experience something similar in their lives. — location: [1373](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1373)
{ #ref-47685}


---
Us versus them: You want to use us-versus-them stories to polarize your audience. Who do you define as the “us” in your audience (people that do the types of things they need to be successful with what you are selling) versus the “them” (those who don’t comply with what you need them to do)? Using these types of stories will draw your raving fans even closer and give them a rallying cry against what they don’t want to become. — location: [1377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1377)
{ #ref-3808}


---
Before and after: These are stories of transformation, and they work great in any market. For example, in the weight-loss market, you may show your before and after pictures and tell the story of your journey. In financial markets, you could show your home before your success and then after. Every product or service promises a result, so the question is, “What was life like for you before you applied the result, and what does it look like now?” — location: [1381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1381)

Amazing discovery: Every day on your journey to help serve your dream customer, you should be discovering new things that can help them on their journey.

Secret-telling: You’ve probably noticed from the titles of my first three books that this is the one I go to a lot. What secrets do you know or have heard from other people that you can share with your audience? Even as a kid, when someone told me they had a secret, it would drive me crazy until I found out exactly what it was. The same is true online; a good secret can pull someone into your story better than almost anything else you can do. — location: [1387](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1387)

Third-person testimonial: Sharing other people’s successes with your products and services provides powerful social proof. Get as many third-person testimonials from your customers, clients, and students as you can. Then tell their stories over and over. — location: [1390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1390)

Before I build out any new sales funnel, the first thing I want to do is find other people who already have a successful funnel and are selling to my target market. If I can’t find other businesses, then I won’t continue to move forward. But if I can find others who are already successfully selling to the chosen market, then I can reverse engineer what they’re doing. We call this process “funnel hacking,” and it’s the reason people inside our community call each other “funnel hackers.” — location: [1421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1421)
{ #ref-46057}


---
I look for funnels to model in one of these three ways: Direct competitors: A direct competitor is a person or company selling something very similar to yours to the same people. Indirect competitors: These are people or companies selling something different than you but to the same demographic. People selling through the same funnel type: In many markets you will not be able to find someone who is successfully selling through a funnel, but that’s okay. If you know that you are going to be using a webinar to sell your product, you can funnel hack anyone using a webinar. — location: [1446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1446)

I became obsessed with my customers’ journey. What did they feel when they saw one of my ads, and what made them want to click on it? When they hit the landing page, what was that experience like, and what happened at each of the phases I took them through? The more aware I was of how someone was probably feeling at each step, the better I could craft messages and processes to help move them through the sale. The better you can make them feel at each step in the process, the more likely they will keep progressing with you through your funnels. — location: [1497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1497)

In the book Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior by Ori and Rom Brafman, I read about a fascinating study that took place at MIT, demonstrating the pre-frame principle in action.10 They tell a story about a class of 70 economics students who were told they would have a substitute professor for the day. Since this professor was new, each student was to read a short biography of the teacher. The bios that were handed out to all the students were identical—except for one phrase. All the bios praised this teacher’s graduate work in economics and listed various fabulous accomplishments. Then half the bios described the professor as “a very warm person,” while the other half described him as “rather cold.” That was the only difference—one phrase. After the lecture, each student was asked to fill out a survey to see how they liked the teacher. The ones who received the “warm” bio said they loved him. They said he was good-natured, considerate of others, and sociable. The students who received the “cold” bio didn’t like him at all. They said he was self-centered, formal, irritable, and ruthless. These students all sat through the same lecture, but the pre-frame changed their perception of what they witnessed. This study is such a cool example of the pre-frame principle at work. — location: [1514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1514)

“Consider a person came from a website that said ‘Russell Brunson is a scam artist. He stole my money. He’s unethical. He’s a liar, and I don’t trust him. Click here to see his new product.’ What do you think will happen when they click through to see the product?” The pre-frame was terrible. That visitor would probably not like me, and I would have a hard time getting them to buy anything. On the other hand, what if the person came from a site that said “Russell is an amazing person. I had a chance to meet him; we talked for an hour, and what he taught me changed my business and my life. My company was able to go from nothing to $1 million in revenue a year. Click here to see his new product.”? The chances of converting that potential customer on my site are much, much higher. I can sell more if the visitor enters my website through a good pre-frame. The frame through which he enters my website completely changes what can happen on the page. So the trick is to figure out how to control the frame that your traffic is coming through. — location: [1536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1536)

“If your prospect is aware of your product and has realized it can satisfy his desire, your headline starts with the product. “If he is not aware of your product, but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. “If he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned with the general problem, your headline starts with the problem and crystallizes it into a specific need.” — location: [1566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1566)

{ #ref-12354}

Cold traffic is made up of people who have a problem, but they aren’t even aware yet of the potential solutions.

{ #ref-31983}


---
A hot traffic bridge is typically very short. You already have a relationship with these people, so you don’t have to do a lot of credibility-building or pre-framing. You can probably just send out a quick email with a link to your landing page and that’s about it. Or you can write a blog post or record a podcast encouraging people to check out your offer. These people will listen and do as you suggest simply because they already know, like, and trust you. — location: [1590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1590)

---
A warm traffic bridge is a little longer than a hot traffic bridge, but not much. If you are targeting your warm traffic on any of the social platforms, you can often use a video to bridge the gap between where they are (on someone else’s fan page or watching a YouTube video) and where you want to take them. — location: [1593](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1593)

A cold traffic bridge is the longest type of bridge.

find your potential buyers immediately after you qualify subscribers. Don’t wait a day or a week. Qualify buyers right away. My early mentor, Dan Kennedy, taught me this golden principle: a buyer is a buyer is a buyer. If someone is willing to buy from you once, they’ll continue to buy from you as long as you keep offering value. So as soon as someone fills out their name and email address and clicks the Submit button, they should land on a sales page that offers them your first premium offer. — location: [1626](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1626)

I want to make sure that I give people the ability to buy when they want to buy.

What’s the temperature of the traffic you’re driving? What’s the pre-frame bridge you’re taking potential buyers through? Are you qualifying subscribers on the landing page? Are you qualifying your buyers on the sales page and your hyperactives on the upsell pages? Are you aging and ascending the relationship to match the buyer with the offer they really need the most? Are you changing the selling environment for your high-ticket offers?

I want to quickly recap the seven phases again: Phase #1— Determine traffic temperature: Are the people you are sending into this funnel hot, warm, or cold traffic? Phase #2—Set up the pre-frame bridge: Based on the type of traffic you’re sending, what type of pre-frame bridge do you need to create? Phase #3—Qualify subscribers: Who of all your visitors are willing to give you their email address in exchange for your free offer? Phase #4—Qualify buyers: Who of all your subscribers are willing to give you their credit card in exchange for your first premium offer? Phase #5—Identify hyperactive buyers: Who are the people who are willing to spend more money now to solve their problems? Phase #6—Age and ascend the relationship: Now that I have their contact information, how do I build their relationship with the Attractive Character? Phase #7—Change the selling environment: How can I move them up my value ladder by taking them outside of just my online funnels? — location: [1683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1683)

Backstory: Once you have their attention with emotional drama, you’re going to go back and tell them the backstory. Tell them the events that led up to the high-drama moment. How in the world did you get yourself into such a predicament? Typically, your backstory is going to take you back to a similar spot the readers may be in now. If you’re helping them to lose weight, you take them back to when you were overweight. If you’re teaching them to achieve financial freedom, take them back to a time when you were broke. — location: [1815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1815)

Wall: This backstory will lead up to a spot where you got stuck and hit a wall. Usually this is where the readers are in their lives right now. They’re stuck, and that’s why they’re open to your answers. You explain to them how you hit that wall and then found the answer. But don’t give them the answer yet. Just open the loop and promise to close it in Email #3. — location: [1819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1819)

Email #3—Epiphany: Today you get to reveal the big epiphany you had that will tie back to your product. It’s the moment that everything turned around for you.

Email #5—Urgency and CTA: This is usually the last email in my Soap Opera Sequence. The goal is to give the reader one last push to go take action right now. You do that by adding urgency into the equation and using a call to action (CTA). Up to this point, you’ve been casually using CTAs, but in this last email, you want to light a little fire under your readers. What legitimate reasons can you come up with that would make them need to take action right away? Your webinar starts tomorrow. You only have 10 seats left at your event. You only ordered 1,000 books, and most of them are gone. You’re pulling the video offline. — location: [1838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1838)

If you just send out entertaining emails and don’t tie in your products or services, you won’t make a dime (even if you’re the best storyteller in the world!).

Luckily, there were some brilliant marketers who suggested, “What if, instead of someone coming to our website being shown a pop-up to get their email address, we made the pop-up the page that people saw first? It would act like a gateway and it would force people to put in their email address to actually see what they wanted to see. If we created a good enough offer, it would literally ‘squeeze’ the email from them before they got to our website!” — location: [1950](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=1950)

A summit funnel is another type of lead funnel, but one that is strategically designed to let you leverage other people’s traffic and co-brand yourself to build your authority in a market. — location: [2118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2118)
{ #ref-6973}


---
Invitations: First, a person who organizes the summit, known as the host, invites a group of colleagues in their niche to be interviewed. The ideal interviewee is a colleague in your niche who has their own email list of your ideal clients. A good-size summit has about 30 speakers, though you will likely find yourself approaching more people than that before you arrive at your final list of confirmed participants. — location: [2155](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2155)
{ #ref-63903}


---
Interviews: Second, the host prerecords interviews with these guest speakers, which will be broadcast online for a limited period of time later during the summit event. Promotions: Third, motivated by affiliate commissions and the prestige of being a featured speaker at an event, guest speakers join with the host to promote the virtual summit in advance of the interviews being broadcast. This is the key! By using a well-constructed virtual summit funnel, the host can collect the email addresses of everyone who opts in to watch the free summit event, as well as sell products to the summit registrants. — location: [2158](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2158)
{ #ref-49963}


---
Page #2: The Special Offer Page After registering for the free summit on the previous page, the lead is taken to the second page in the funnel, which presents a special offer. This type of page is usually an order form which has three main parts: Registration confirmation: At the top of the page, the lead should be reassured that they have successfully registered for the free event, and an email with information about that will be sent to their inbox. All-access pass offer: Next, an offer is introduced for the lead to purchase. A video featuring the summit host is usually included, which explains the offer, followed by text and images to provide further detail, just like a regular sales page would have. Order form: Finally, the order form at the bottom of the page will allow leads to make a purchase. What is the all-access pass offer? Remember, the lead magnet in a virtual summit funnel is the free pass to the summit itself where attendees can watch the interviews for a limited amount of time. By upgrading to the all-access pass, someone can get access to a membership area where they will have lifetime, unlimited access to all the summit interviews. — location: [2178](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2178)
{ #ref-11945}


---
Additionally, the all-access pass might come with bonus materials, which are usually related to the summit content. These could include bonus interviews with speakers not shown during the free event, transcripts of the speakers’ interviews, a PDF of compiled notes, or downloadable MP3 files of the interviews. Alternatively, you could present another special offer that moves people up your value ladder, such as a challenge funnel, which could go to leads on this page instead of an all-access pass and could position the unrestricted summit interview access as a bonus to this offer. This is the approach taken by the ClickFunnels team during the 30 Days Summit. — location: [2190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2190)

The other way we sell an offer like this earlier in the value ladder is through something I like to call an unboxing funnel. In this funnel, we take the whole offer that may typically sell for $997, and instead of selling it as an entire package, we unbox that offer and sell a part of it on each page inside the funnel. — location: [2230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2230)
{ #ref-56360}


---
I could have used a presentation funnel (such as a webinar or a product launch funnel) and sold this offer for $840, but instead I decided to unbox this offer and put it into a book funnel that I could sell lower on the value ladder. I unboxed this offer by pulling out each product and putting it into a step of the unboxing funnel. — location: [2238](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2238)
{ #ref-40823}


---
By “unboxing” this offer, I’m able to get a lot more people to become customers and start moving up the value ladder. If I do it correctly, my average cart value that I make from each sale will be high enough that I can spend a lot of money to acquire customers and I can add a lot more fuel (people) into my business. — location: [2244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2244)

the customer had already pulled a credit card out of their wallet and made a commitment toward the concept we were selling, about 25 percent of free-plus-shipping customers bought the upsell offer. That means we made $394 per 100 visitors, and we got eight new buyers on our list. I doubled my money and got seven times more customers by adding in a free-plus-shipping offer! — location: [2269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2269)
{ #ref-64831}


---
There is something very powerful that happens inside the buyer’s mind after you get them to make a commitment by saying the first yes. They’ve already done the hard work, and because they have already started on the path that this solution offers, it’s so much easier to get them to say the second yes. The friction is gone. You get them started by saying yes to a small thing, and they are much more likely to say yes to a larger thing later. People ask me if they can just sell (or just give away) a digital product instead of the free-plus-shipping offer. The answer is yes, you can (and we do inside lead funnels), but you are missing out on the ability to quickly discover who your buyers are. If I just give it away free digitally, I lose the power of qualifying the buyer when they pay the shipping costs, and I also lose the ability to do a one-click upsell on the next page. — location: [2274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2274)

Any upsells more than two and it hurt the lifetime value of our customers; any upsells less than two made it hard to make any money. — location: [2290](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2290)

started adding these bumps to each of my funnels and found that about 33 percent of the people who bought my first product purchased this stealth upsell, and it had no decrease in lifetime value of the customers. They didn’t see it as an additional upsell in the sales funnel. — location: [2300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2300)
{ #ref-64073}

The first metric is cost per acquisition, or CPA. How much money does it cost you on average to get a new customer? If I’m running Facebook ads to sell a copy of my book, how much money does it cost to sell that book? If I’m spending $20 in ads to sell a book, my CPA is $20. The second metric is average cart value, or ACV. This is how much money you make on average inside of the funnel for each customer you acquire. If I get 10 people to buy my book, and I make $1,000 in total sales throughout that entire funnel, then my ACV is $100. Then I look at these two numbers together. If my CPA (how much it costs me to get one customer) is $20, and my ACV (how much I make for each customer) is $100, then I know my profit for each customer is $80. — location: [2309](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2309)
{ #ref-22000}


---
If my CPA is less than my ACV, my funnel is working and I can spend as much money as possible to keep getting customers. It’s like a slot machine where I put $20 in and I get $100 back. I’ll keep putting money in for as long as that lasts. But if my CPA is bigger than my ACV, the funnel isn’t working and I need to go back to the drawing board. — location: [2317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2317)

The majority of your prospects are emotional buyers and they’ll buy from this top block. For the buyers who are more logical, I put a section under the top block with a long list of bullet points showing them logically what they will learn when they invest. Finally, for the buyers who buy because they fear the offer will be taken away, I end the page with urgency and scarcity to push them off the fence and buy. — location: [2373](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2373)

Having the bump earlier usually hurts conversions. You want the purchase to have already happened in your customer’s mind; at this point, they’re at the checkout stand just grabbing an impulse offer on their way out the door. — location: [2405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2405)

Most e-commerce sellers have to focus on free organic traffic because they typically don’t have a high enough average cart value to pay for ads. The problem: “A confused mind always says no!” When you show up to a page with dozens of different products on them, it can get confusing, and because of that, even people who are interested don’t end up buying. — location: [2477](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2477)

Product selector and order form bump: On the second step in the order form, we actually have two levers that we can use to increase our average cart value.

The thank-you page for a cart funnel usually has two primary functions. The first is to thank them for their purchase and let them know what to expect next. We’ll often tell them when their order will come, how to get customer service, etc. The second function is to direct people into your next funnels. In a cart funnel, we do this by creating what we call an “offer wall,” where you show the other offers that you have. This will guide people into other funnels that you have created. — location: [2539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2539)

Other important elements of your challenge funnel sales page are: The story: The story needs to be short and compelling.

The path: What are the topics you will cover during the challenge and how will it benefit the visitor? Clearly show the journey your challengers will walk on as they go through the process of transformation. The prizes: Everyone loves prizes! When choosing your prizes, consider seeding the offer you will make at the end of the challenge that ascends the challenger up your value ladder. — location: [2645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085BSSHJ6&location=2645)

The presentation’s goal is to educate the person on the problem they have, break the false beliefs that are keeping them from moving forward with you, and get them to take action now.
