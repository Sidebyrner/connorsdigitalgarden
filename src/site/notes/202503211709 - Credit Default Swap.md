> A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative contract that allows an investor to swap or offset their credit risk with that of another investor. 

In a CDS, the buyer makes periodic payments to the seller, and in exchange, the seller agrees to pay a lump sum to the buyer if the underlying credit instrument, such as a bond or loan, defaults or experiences a similar credit event like bankruptcy or restructuring[1][2][3].

### How CDS Works
- **Parties Involved**: The two parties to a CDS are the credit protection buyer and the credit protection seller. The buyer is typically seeking to hedge against the risk of default by a borrower, known as the reference entity[4].
- **Payment Structure**: The buyer pays an ongoing premium, often referred to as the CDS spread, to the seller until the contract matures. In return, the seller agrees to compensate the buyer if a credit event occurs[1][2].
- **Credit Events**: These include failure to pay, [[000 Inbox/202503211603 - Bankruptcy\|202503211603 - Bankruptcy]], and restructuring. Upon such an event, the seller pays the buyer the face value of the bond or its market value, depending on the settlement terms[2][4].

### Uses of CDS
CDSs are used for both hedging and speculation:
- **Hedging**: Investors holding debt instruments can purchase CDSs to protect against potential defaults, similar to buying insurance[3][6].
- **Speculation**: Investors can buy CDSs without holding the underlying debt, essentially betting on the likelihood of default by the reference entity. This practice is known as a "naked" CDS[2][5].

### History and Impact
CDSs have been in use since the early 1990s and gained prominence in the early 2000s. They played a significant role in the [[2008 financial crisis\|2008 financial crisis]], as large banks faced substantial losses when numerous underlying credit instruments defaulted simultaneously[1][3]. In response, regulatory measures such as the [[Dodd-Frank Act\|Dodd-Frank Act]] were implemented to increase transparency and oversight in the CDS market[3].
