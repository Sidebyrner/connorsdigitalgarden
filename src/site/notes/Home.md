# Connor's Digital Brain - a repository of learning and discovery

## Welcome to my digital garden!

I currently work in marketing, but my experience has expanded across transportation, customer service, marketing, account management, and most recently, coding with an AI scope.

I write on topics, found in [[Synthesis\|Synthesis]] that delve deeper on topics that intersect leadership and organization. The archive is currently small, but updates will continue to make their way onto this note as writing makes progress.
