### What is EBITDA?

**EBITDA**, or *Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, [[Depreciation\|Depreciation]], and [[Amortization\|Amortization]]*, is a financial metric used to evaluate a company's profitability and operational performance by excluding non-operational expenses like interest, taxes, and non-cash accounting items such as depreciation and amortization. It provides a clearer view of a company's core earnings potential and cash-generating ability from its primary business operations[][][].

### Key Features of EBITDA

1. **Exclusion of Non-Operational Costs**: By removing interest (related to financing decisions), taxes (dependent on jurisdiction), and non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization, EBITDA focuses solely on operational performance[][].
2. **Cash Flow Proxy**: Although not an exact measure of cash flow, EBITDA is often used as a proxy to assess a company's ability to generate cash for reinvestment, debt repayment, or dividends[][].
3. **Standardized Comparison**: It allows for easier comparison of companies across industries by eliminating the effects of different capital structures, tax environments, and accounting policies[][].

### How is EBITDA Calculated?

EBITDA can be derived using two main formulas:

1. **From Net Income**:
   $$
   \text{EBITDA} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Interest Expense} + \text{Taxes} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization}
   $$

2. **From Operating Income (EBIT)**:
   $$
   \text{EBITDA} = \text{EBIT (Operating Income)} + \text{Depreciation} + \text{Amortization}
   $$

Where:
- **Net Income** is the company's profit after all expenses.
- **EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)** represents operating income before financing and tax costs.
- **Depreciation** accounts for the wear-and-tear of tangible assets like machinery.
- **Amortization** refers to the gradual write-off of intangible assets like patents or goodwill[][][].

### Why is EBITDA Important?

1. **Operational Focus**: It isolates earnings from core operations, providing insights into how efficiently a company generates profits without external factors like financing or accounting policies[][].
2. **Valuation Metric**: Investors and analysts use EBITDA in valuation multiples like EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to EBITDA) to assess a company's worth relative to its peers[][].
3. **Debt Analysis**: Lenders often rely on EBITDA to evaluate a company's ability to service debt since it approximates cash flow available for repayment[][].
4. **Mergers and Acquisitions**: In M&A activity, EBITDA helps assess a target company's profitability without being influenced by its capital structure or tax strategies[][].

---

### Limitations of EBITDA

While EBITDA provides valuable insights, it has notable limitations:
- **Excludes Capital Expenditures**: It ignores necessary investments in fixed assets, which can significantly impact cash flow[][].
- **Non-Cash Expenses Matter**: Depreciation and amortization represent real costs associated with asset usage that are excluded in EBITDA calculations[][].
- **Not GAAP-Compliant**: Since it is not governed by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), companies may calculate it differently, reducing comparability[][].

Despite its limitations, EBITDA remains one of the most widely used metrics in financial analysis for evaluating operational performance and comparing companies across industries.
