Market volatility refers to the magnitude and frequency of price fluctuations in financial markets, often used as a measure of risk and uncertainty. It is typically quantified using statistical tools like standard [[deviation\|deviation]] or [[variance\|variance]], which measure how much an asset's price deviates from its average over a specific time period. 

High volatility indicates sharp and unpredictable price swings
low volatility suggests more stable price movements[[1\|1]][[2\|2]][[8\|8]].

Volatility can be driven by various factors, including:
- economic conditions (e.g., [[interest rate changes\|interest rate changes]], [[inflation\|inflation]]),
- geopolitical events (e.g., wars, [[pandemics\|pandemics]]), and investor sentiment.

It plays a crucial role in investment decisions, helping investors assess risk, price options, and construct diversified portfolios. While volatility is often associated with risk, it can also present opportunities for short-term gains, particularly for active traders. Tools like the [[Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)\|Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)]], also known as the "fear index," are used to gauge market sentiment and implied future volatility[[1\|1]][[3\|3]][[4\|4]].
