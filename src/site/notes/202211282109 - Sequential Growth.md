>Sequential growth is a measure of a company's short-term financial performance that compares the results in a recent period to those of the period immediately preceding it. In [financial reporting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp), sequential growth often compares results [between two quarters](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qoq.asp).
- A company might report 3% sequential sales growth, meaning that its revenue has increased by 3% since the previous quarter.
## Example: Amazon (AMZN)
 In Q1 2018, sales roles 43% annually to $51.0 billion, although the figure fell from the previous quarter by an estimated 15.5%. However, this is to be expected for Amazon and other retailers since that previous quarter (Q4 2017) included heightened sales figures because of the holidays.
