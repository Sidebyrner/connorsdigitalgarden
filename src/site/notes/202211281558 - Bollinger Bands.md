## What are Bollinger bands?
- Bollinger bands are a technical analysis tool that helps define the range within which an asset is supposed to trade. It was developed by well-known technical trader, John Bollinger.
- Bollinger bands consist of a middle band with two outer bands. The middle band is a simple average. The upper band and lower band are plotted at a standard deviation level above and below the moving average.
- The default Bollinger bands on Webull consist of a 20-d moving average and two bands plotted at a standard deviation level of 2.
## What can we learn from Bollinger bands?
Bollinger bands give investors information on future volatility, whether prices are high or low on a relative basis, how strong a trend is, etc.
### Volatility
Standard deviation measures volatility. When the asset price becomes more volatile, the distance between the bands widens. When the asset price becomes less volatile, the distance narrows.
### One important concept in Bollinger bands is squeeze. 
- When the upper and lower bands move close together, a squeeze occurs. **A squeeze represents low volatility. 
	- It is believed that following the squeeze, the bands will separate remarkably.** Investors may need to watch for a dramatic price change next. 
	- Conversely, the wider the bands are, the more likely that price will stabilize.
## Limitations of Bollinger bands
Bollinger bands can be risky if used as a standalone indicator. 
- They simply provide information to help investors determine the volatility and price level of an asset. 
- **They do not provide** direct trading signals. It’s recommended that investors _use Bollinger bands together with other indicators_ as well as fundamental analysis.
