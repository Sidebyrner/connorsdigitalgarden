## Calculating Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)Â 

To calculate CAGR, divide the value of an investment at the end of the period in question by its value at the beginning of that period, raise the result to the power of one divided by the period length, and subtract one from the subsequent result.

This can be written:

### What is Compound Growth Rate?

The **compound growth rate** is a measure used to determine the consistent rate at which an investment or financial metric grows over multiple time periods, taking into account the compounding effect. Unlike simple growth rates, which can be volatile, compound growth rates smooth out fluctuations and provide a more stable and accurate representation of growth. The most common form of compound growth rate is the **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**, which calculates the average annual growth rate of an investment or metric over a specified period[[1\|1]][[2\|2]][[6\|6]].

### How is it Calculated?

The formula for calculating CAGR is:

$$
\text{CAGR} = \left(\frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
$$

Where:
- **Ending Value**: The value of the investment or metric at the end of the period.
- **Beginning Value**: The value at the start of the period.
- **n**: The number of years in the period[[2\|2]][[4\|4]][[7\|7]].

For example, if an investment grows from $10,000 to $15,000 over 5 years:
$$
\text{CAGR} = \left(\frac{15,000}{10,000}\right)^{\frac{1}{5}} - 1 = 8.45\%
$$
This means the investment grew at an average annual rate of 8.45% over 5 years[[4\|4]].

### Applications in Business and Investing

[[202211282112 - compound annual growth rate\|202211282112 - compound annual growth rate]]s are widely used to analyze and compare performance across investments or business metrics. Key applications include:
1. **Investment Analysis**: CAGR helps investors evaluate long-term returns on [[000 Inbox/202503211631 - Stock\|202503211631 - Stock]]s, [[mutual fund\|mutual fund]]s, and other assets while accounting for compounding effects[[3\|3]][[7\|7]].
2. **Business Metrics**: Companies use CAGR to measure revenue growth, EBITDA, [[capital expenditures (capex)\|capital expenditures (capex)]], or customer base expansion over time[[6\|6]].
3. **Forecasting**: Historical CAGR can be used to project future growth trends under similar conditions[[3\|3]][[6\|6]].
4. **Strategic Planning**: Businesses rely on CAGR to set realistic goals and allocate resources effectively[[3\|3]].

### Benefits of Using Compound Growth Rate

- **Smoothing Volatility**: CAGR eliminates year-to-year fluctuations by assuming steady annual growth[[6\|6]].
- **Comparative Analysis**: It enables investors and businesses to compare growth rates across investments or divisions regardless of size or industry[[3\|3]].
- **Predictive Insights**: Helps forecast future performance based on historical data[[4\|4]].

While CAGR simplifies complex data into a single metric, it assumes steady growth and omits volatility. Therefore, it is best used alongside other metrics for a comprehensive analysis[[6\|6]].
