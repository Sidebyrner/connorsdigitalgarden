Credit Suisse, founded on July 5, 1856, as [[Schweizerische Kreditanstalt\|Schweizerische Kreditanstalt]], is a global financial services firm based in Zürich, Switzerland. Initially established to finance the expansion of Switzerland's rail network and promote industrialization, it has evolved into a leading provider of investment banking, private banking, and asset management services. Over the years, Credit Suisse has expanded its operations globally, operating in more than 50 countries. The bank has been involved in significant mergers and acquisitions, including the purchase of [[CS First Boston\|CS First Boston]] and [[Bank Leu\|Bank Leu]], which have contributed to its growth as a major financial institution[1](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/our-company/who-we-are.html)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse).

In recent years, Credit Suisse faced significant challenges, including financial instability and regulatory issues. In March 2023, the bank was acquired by [[UBS Group AG\|UBS Group AG]] in a deal brokered by the Swiss government to prevent a potential banking crisis[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Credit_Suisse_by_UBS)[7](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/business/ubs-completes-credit-suisse-takeover/index.html). This acquisition marked a significant shift for Credit Suisse, which is now a subsidiary of UBS. Despite its challenges, Credit Suisse remains a key player in the global financial sector, known for its expertise in wealth management and investment #banking. The integration with UBS is expected to enhance its capabilities and strengthen its position in the market[8](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/media/display-page-ndp/en-20230612-ubs-credit-suisse-acquisition.html). Credit Suisse's legacy includes its role in shaping Switzerland's economic development and its contributions to international financial markets[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse)[6](https://economictimes.com/news/international/business/how-credit-suisse-has-evolved-over-167-years/articleshow/98761105.cms).
